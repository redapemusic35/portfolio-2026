# About

PhD in Philosophy with 20+ years blending storytelling and education, using narratives to unpack complex philosophical theories. While volunteering with minority and disadvantaged youth, I observed how disparaging media shapes perceptions, inspiring a philosophy laboratory. As Director of the Salerno Center for Human Flourishing, I use game-based learning to foster empathy and ethical reasoning. My research, including Play and Meaning (under review), explores narrative ethics in media, drawing on Values@Play and Casas-Roma’s interactive frameworks. This lab leverages music, games, and film to teach rational self-sufficiency and critical thinking, countering negative stereotypes with empowering narratives. I aim to scale this model through an edtech foundation, transforming education for underserved communities globally. I’m eager to connect with educators, technologists, and innovators to advance arts-driven, ethical education. Let’s create cultural impact together!
