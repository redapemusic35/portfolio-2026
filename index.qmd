# About

I am a philosopher and educator who is deeply passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence and interactive storytelling to enhance human reasoning, productivity, ethical decision-making, and overall flourishing—particularly for underserved youth. In 2024, I obtained a PhD in Philosophy from Saint Louis University. Now, with a small team, build and integrate AI-driven tools—such as D&D campaign generators and develop massively multiplayer online game environments—into educational platforms that foster critical thinking, moral imagination, and empathy. As Founder and Director of the Saleno Center for Human Flourishing, I lead initiatives that explore how digital narratives and games can counter harmful stereotypes, promote moral well-being, and guide users toward more thoughtful, connected lives. I am currently serving as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Stetson University, where I teach courses in logic, aesthetics, philosophy of law, and introduction to philosophy. I am currently developing courses in the philosophy of mind and personhood. I always emphasizing real-world applications, collaboration, and rigorous ethical reflection. My work, including forthcoming publications like Moral Autonomy and Personhood in Pop Culture, draws on narrative ethics to show how fiction and interactive media can cultivate affective moral understanding and support more examined, meaningful existence.
