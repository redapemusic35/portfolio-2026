### Thursdays: The Experience Machine

* Time: After office hours (1:00–3:00 PM)

What it is: Come play video games with a philosophical twist! We'll explore deep questions raised by gaming.

Some of the questions we'll think about together:

* Is it okay to exploit game mechanics to your advantage?
* Is sharing secrets outside the game world cheating?
* Is it wrong to gang up on defenseless players?
* What exactly makes someone an A$$Hole in a PVP environment?
* Bonus debate: Is philosophy D&D better than regular D&D?
 * Get ready for some weird unconventional DND adventures . . .

Gaming with friends is always more fun (and thought-provoking) in a group:

Hope to see many of you there—whether for quiet reading, heated game debates, or just good company! Questions? Drop by office hours. 😊
