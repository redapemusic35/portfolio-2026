# Introduction

Previously, this course used John Nolt's *Logics* as its text book. While I still believe that the heavy emphasis on formal logic is important, it was not intuitive, and logic done well is intuitive. I eventually discovered Peter @smit21b's [*Logic Matters*](https://www.logicmatters.net/). I recommended it to students as a supplementary reading and was pleased with the feedback and the improvement in their understanding. I am now relying on Smith's introductory text as the main text for this course, although I will contrast it with Nolt's more formal approach at various points.

**Focus:** The focus of this course is . . .

* Informal Logic
* Classical Propositional Logic syntax and semantics
* Natural Deduction Proofs for Propositional Logic
* Formalization Rules and General Propositions
* Predicate (Quantification Rules) Logic Semantics and Inference
