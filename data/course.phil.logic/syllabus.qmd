In this course, we will systematically look at arguments. We look at arguments for several reasons. One is to analyze the statements that people make. For instance, considering the photo above, what does it mean when someone says: "Holmes wears a top hat."

For one, the statement usually does not refer to an actually existent entity, thing, or person. Perhaps there really was someone alive at one time, whose name was 'Holmes', and it is conceivable that this person wore a top hat. But the statement 'Holmes wears a top hat' usually does not refer to *that* person, but rather to the fictional character from the Author Conan Doyle novels.

Even though the statement refers to a fictional character however, it is still a true statement, but how?

We will focus on these kinds of questions in two ways. Consider the following:

1. Cups of coffee from GreatBeanz that looked and tasted just fine
haven’t killed anyone in the past.
2. My present cup of GreatBeanz coffee looks and tastes just fine.

Taking sentences 1 and 2 above, it will be likely that you might conclude 3 following below.

3. This present cup of GreatBeanz coffee won’t kill me

While we do this kind of reasoning and argumentation all the time, it is not the kind of reasoning and argumentation that we will focus on. Why?

Consider the following slight change:

3. My arch nemesis has poisoned this cup of coffee with an invisible and tastless poison.

By systematically looking at arguments, we will hope to avoid these kinds of outcomes. We do this by focusing on what is called internal cogency or logical validity. This is merely a fancy way of saying that if one accepts sentences 1 and 2, then they must accept 3.

Compare the argument above with the following one:

1. All Republican voters support capital punishment.
2. Jo is a Republican voter.

Therefore

3. Jo supports capital punishment.

Unlike the first argument, if someone accepts 1 and 2, then they must accept 3. What this means is that if they will reject 3, than it is either because they've rejected 1 or 2 or 1 and 2 are not relevant, but they cannot *logically* accept 1 and 2 while rejecting 3.

In this course, we will look at how critical thinking and reasoning will help us to evaluate the truth of statements, whether they are about fictional characters, or coffee.

## PLOs

Every course within a given department is expected to satisfy one (or
more) of that program’s Learning Outcomes (PLOs), as articulated in that
department's Curriculum Map. Students who take a philosophy course
will develop their capacity to (I.) understand and interpret philosophical
texts, (II.) identify arguments, (III.) critically assess arguments, (IV.)
identify philosophical traditions and methods, (IV.) and/or communicate
clearly and effectively. The philosophy department’s five Learning
Outcomes are arranged hierarchically, so that the later Learning
Outcomes presuppose some familiarity with the lower-order skills. The
assignments and work within a given course are expected to develop the
skills associated with that course’s PLO, while strengthening the lower-
order skills and setting the stage for the development of the higher-
order skills. The PLO associated with this course is:

II. Argumentation: Students can identify and evaluate argument
structures effectively.

[Information about the philosophy department’s PLOs can be found at:]( http://www.stetson.edu/artsci/philosophy/curriculummap.php)

## Academic Accommodation

If you anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a
course, you should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to
ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are
necessary, you must register with Academic Success through the
Accessibility Services Center located at 209 E. Bert Fish Dr. (386-822-
7127; http://www.stetson.edu/administration/academic-success/)
and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable
accommodations. The student, course instructor and Academic
Success will plan how best to coordinate accommodations.
Academic Integrity - DO NOT CHEAT.
As a member of Stetson University, I agree to uphold the highest
standards of integrity in my academic work. I promise that I will
neither give nor receive unauthorized aid of any kind on my tests,
papers, and assignments. When using the ideas, thoughts, or words of
another in my work, I will always provide clear acknowledgement of
the individuals and sources on which I am relying. I will avoid using
fraudulent, falsified, or fabricated evidence and/or material. I will
refrain from resubmitting without authorization work for one class
that was obtained from work previously submitted for academic credit
in another class. I will not destroy, steal, or make inaccessible any
academic resource material. By my actions and my example, I will
strive to promote the ideals of honesty, responsibility, trust, fairness,
and respect that are at the heart of Stetson's Honor System.
Cheating violates university regulations and is a reportable offense
that may result in academic suspension or dismissal from Stetson
University. Every violation of the Honor System will be promptly
reported to the Honor System Council for further investigation.
In addition to these academic integrity standards, I expect students to
treat everyone in the classroom—the instructor, fellow students, and
guests—with common courtesy and respect.
