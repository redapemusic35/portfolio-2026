# Logical Validity

* logically valid arguments are deductively valid
* but not all deductively valid arguments are logically valid

---

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Vocabulary such as: 'all' and 'some', 'and' and 'or' and 'if', that does not refer to specific things, properties or relations, are topic-neutral
2. An inference step is logically valid iff it is deductively valid
   * given how the topic-neutral notions occur in the premisses and conclusion
   * ***and*** some premisses logically entail a certain conclusion if the inference form premisses to conclusion is logically valid.
3. A proposition is logically necessary iff it is necessarily true, in virtue of how topic-neutral notions feature in it.
4. We only need to concern ourselves with validity which depends on uncontroversially topic-neutral vocabulary: 'all', 'some', 'and' and 'or' etc.
5. We will accept that our given definitions of validity lead to strange arguments

We will accept that our given definitions of validity lead to strange arguments

> Jack is married. Jack is not married. So th eworld will end tomorrow!

* The above is logically valid given our definition in 2.1:

* An inference step is *valid* iff there is no possible situation in which its premises would be true and its conclusion false.

---

* Deductive Validity: An inference step is *valid* iff there is no possible situation in which its premises would be true and its conclusion false.
* Logical Validity: Arguments whose load-bearing principles of inference can be laid out using only topic-neutral notions.
* Logical Validity: Patterns of reasoning that can be used when talking about any subject matter at all.
* Logical Validity: Universally applicable patterns of reasoning

---

Therefore:

* An inference step is logically valid if and only if it is deductively valid in
virtue of the way that topic-neutral notions occur in the premisses and
conclusion.

## Topic Neutral Terminology

Vocabulary like 'all' and 'some' and 'or', 'not' and 'if' etc.

* does not refer to specific things, properties or relations,
* useful for discussing any topic (topic neutral)

Deductively Valid:

1. Jill is a mother
2. So, Jill is a parent

---

Logically Valid:

1. Anything that is a mother is a parent
2. Jill is a mother
2. So, Jill is a parent

---

Consider:


1. Any *m* is a *p*
2. [Jill] is a *m*
2. So, [Jill] is a *p*

---

1. Any *m* is a *p*
2. Bob is a mother
3. So Bob is a parent

---

1. Jack is a bachelor
2. So Jack is unmarried

---

> How can we show that an unobviously valid inference is logically valid? By
a suitable proof, of course – meaning a proof where the pattern of inference used
at each step can be displayed using a purely logical schema.

---

Logically Valid:

1. Anything that is a mother is a parent
2. Jill is a mother
2. So, Jill is a parent

---

Consider:


1. Any *m* is a *p*
2. [Jill] is a *m*
2. So, [Jill] is a *p*

---

1. Any *m* is a *p*
2. Bob is a *m*
3. So Bob is a *p*

---

1. Jack is a bachelor
2. So Jack is unmarried

---

Proof:

1. A bachelor is an unmarried male
2. Jack is a bachelor
3. So Jack is a male (from 2)
4. So Jack is unmarried (from 1, 2, 3)

---

1. A *b* is a (*u* and *m*)
2. Jack is a *b*
3. So Jack is a (*u* and *m*)

Why?

'is [more t than]' is a predicate:
