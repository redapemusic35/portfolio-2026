# PL Syntax

> We start our more formal work by looking at length at a very restricted class of arguments, namely those whose relevant logical structure turns simply on the presence in premisses and/or conclusions of ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘not’ (used as so-called sentential or propositional connectives).

## Syntatic Rules for PL Languages

Three stages for defining well-formed formulas

![](../../../readings/wff-definition.png)

(a) we fix the alphabet of symbols we
can use in a PL language;
(b) we stipulate what count as the ‘atomic’ wffs of a
given language; finally,
(c) we explain how other, ‘molecular’, wffs are built up
from the atoms.

## Remember the Three Connectives

| | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| And | | $\land$ | \* | & |
| Or | | $\lor$ | | |
| Not | | $\neg$ | \~ | |

Then let’s render the following into this miniature formalized language:

(1) Jack doesn’t love Jill.
(2) Jack is wise and he loves Jill.
(3) Either Jack loves Jill or Jo does.
(4) Jack and Jill love each other.
(5) Neither Jack loves Jill nor does Jo.
(6) It isn’t the case that Jack loves Jill nor does Jill love Jack.
(7) Either Jack is not wise or both he and Jo love Jill.
(8) It isn’t the case that either Jack loves Jill or Jill loves Jack.

::: {.r-text-fit}

Give negations of the following in natural English:

(1) It is not the case that both Jack and Jill went up the hill.
(2) Neither Jack nor Jill went up the hill.
(3) No one loves Jack.
(4) Only tall men love Jill.
(5) Everyone who loves Jack admires Jill.
(6) Someone loves both Jack and Jill.
(7) Some who love Jill are not themselves loveable.
(8) Jill always arrives on time.
(9) Whoever did that ought to pay for the damage.
(10) Whenever it rains, it pours.
(11) No one may smoke.

::: {.r-text-fit}

(1) Jack is unwise and loves Jill.
(2) Jack and Jo both love Jill.
(3) It isn’t true that Jack doesn’t love Jill.
(4) Jack loves Jill but Jo doesn’t.
(5) Jack doesn’t love Jill, neither is he wise.
(6) Either Jack loves Jill or Jill loves Jack.
(7) Either Jack loves Jill or Jill loves Jack, but not both.
(8) Either Jack is unwise or he loves Jill and Jo loves Jill.

## 9.2 Construction histories, parse trees

(a) Assume we are dealing with a PL language whose atoms are ‘P’, ‘Q’, ‘R’, ‘S’. Let’s use our stated W-rules to prove that the sequence of symbols ¬((P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(¬Q ∨ R))

---

(1) ‘P’ is a wff. (premise)
(2) ‘Q’ is a wff. (premise)
(3) ‘R’ is a wff. (premise)
(4) ‘(P ∨ Q)’ is a wff. (from 1, 2 by W3)
(5) ‘¬Q’ is a wff. (from 2 by W4)
(6) ‘(¬Q ∨ R)’ is a wff. (from 5, 3 by W3)
(7) ‘¬(¬Q ∨ R)’ is a wff. (from 6 by W4)
(8) ‘((P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(¬Q ∨ R))’ is a wff. (from 4, 7 by W2)
(9) ‘¬((P ∨ Q) ∧ ¬(¬Q ∨ R))’ is a wff. (from 8 by W4)
