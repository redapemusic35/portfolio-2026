### Semantic Trees

> A Semantic tree is a device for displaying all the valuations on which a formula or set of formulas is true. [Nolt's, 65]

Helpful to read Chapter 10 of "IFL2".

> We have designed PL languages so that the syntactic structure of a wff, i.e. the way that the symbols are put together into grammatical strings, is a perfect guide to its semantic structure, and in particular to the way the
truth value of the whole will depend on the truth values of the atoms.

Trees then depend on the concept that for a formula to be true, its parts are also true. As such, every branch that is written into a truth tree, is true.
