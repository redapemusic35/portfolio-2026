## Grading Calculation

Total Points: 640 points, distributed as above.

* Formula: Raw scores summed across sheets; final percentage = SUM(all assignment points)/640 * 100.

***Letter Grade:***

Final grade uses the following scale (no rounding):

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
|---|---|
| A+ | 97–100% |
| A | 93–96% |
| A- | 90–92% |
| B+ | 87–89% |
| B | 83–86% |
| B- | 80–82% |
| C+ | 77–79% |
| C | 73–76% |
| C- | 70–72% |
| D+ | 67–69% |
| D | 63–66% |
| D- | 60–62% |
| F | <60% |

### Example: Perfect scores = 32 + 160 + 160 + 80 + 80 + 96 + 32 = 640 points (100%, A+).
