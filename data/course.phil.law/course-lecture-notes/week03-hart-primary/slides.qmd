# Modern Positivism – Hart, “Law as the Union of Primary and Secondary Rules” (Feb 1–6)

Core thesis: Law = system of rules, not commands (rejects Austin/Bentham sovereign model).

Primary rules: duty-imposing (what citizens must do).

Secondary rules: power-conferring (rule of recognition, rule of change, rule of adjudication).

Key test: Rule of recognition (what officials accept as valid law).

Strengths: Explains legal systems in modern states; internal point of view.

Classic comparison: Hart vs. Dworkin (rules vs. principles).

## Recap of Previous Topics

- **Kretzmann's Lex Iniusta Non Est Lex**: Natural law perspective – unjust laws are not true laws.
- **Fuller's Case of the Speluncean Explorers**: Hypothetical case exploring judicial philosophies, including positivism, natural law, and purposivism.
- **Bentham's Principles of Morals**: Utilitarian foundation for positivism – laws based on utility, separation of law from morality.

## Introduction to HLA Hart

- HLA Hart (1907–1992): British legal philosopher.
- Key work: *The Concept of Law* (1961).
- Builds on Bentham's positivism but refines it.
- Addresses limitations in command theories (e.g., Austin's sovereign commands).

::: {.notes}
Hart advances positivism by introducing a more sophisticated structure of legal systems.
:::

## Hart's Primary Rules

---

Some prerequisites:

1. Penal law = Just distribution of proposed threats backed by sanctions
2. Legislative and Administrative rules for creating legal entities.
3. Rules vs. Orders distinction
4. Sovereign vs. Legislative authority

---

- **Definition**: Rules that impose duties or obligations directly on individuals (e.g., "Do not steal").
- **Characteristics**:
  - Oblige behavior.
  - Often backed by sanctions.
- **Limitations**: In primitive societies, primary rules alone lead to issues like uncertainty, static nature, and inefficiency in disputes.

::: {.notes}
Primary rules are the basic content of law, similar to Bentham's utility-driven commands.
:::

## Hart's Secondary Rules

- **Definition**: Rules about rules – meta-rules that address deficiencies in primary rules.
- **Types**:
  - **Rule of Recognition**: Identifies what counts as valid law (e.g., constitution).
  - **Rules of Change**: Allow creation, modification, or repeal of primary rules (e.g., legislative procedures).
  - **Rules of Adjudication**: Empower officials to resolve disputes (e.g., courts).

::: {.notes}
Secondary rules provide the framework for a mature legal system, distinguishing law from mere habits.
:::

## Union of Primary and Secondary Rules

- **Core Idea**: Law is the union of primary (content) and secondary (structure) rules.
- **Advantages**:
  - Solves problems in primitive rule systems.
  - Explains legal validity without relying on morality (contra natural law like Kretzmann).
- **Connection to Speluncean Explorers**: Judges apply secondary rules to interpret primary ones.

::: {.notes}
This model separates "is" (positive law) from "ought" (morality), echoing Bentham.
:::

## Legal Obligation

---

* Legal Obligation: beliefs and motivations regarding punishment are not sufficient
* Being Obliged: beliefs and motivations are sufficient

For instance, military service.

## Introduction to Ronald Dworkin

- Ronald Dworkin (1931–2013): American legal philosopher.
- Key work: *The Model of Rules* (1967), part of *Taking Rights Seriously*.
- Critiques legal positivism, including Hart's model.
- Argues positivism is incomplete for hard cases.

::: {.notes}
Dworkin challenges the rule-based view, introducing principles for judicial decision-making.
:::

## Dworkin's Rules vs. Principles

- **Rules**: All-or-nothing; apply strictly if conditions met (e.g., Hart's primary/secondary rules).
- **Principles**: Weigh and balance; have dimension of weight (e.g., justice, fairness).
- **Key Distinction**:
  - Rules are like recipes; principles guide discretion.
- **Critique of Hart**: Positivism focuses on rules but ignores principles in adjudication.

::: {.notes}
Links to Speluncean Explorers: Different judges weigh principles differently in the cave dilemma.
:::

## Dworkin's Model of Rules

- **Positivism's Flaw**: Treats law as only explicit rules; fails in ambiguous cases.
- **Alternative**: Law includes rules + principles + policies.
- **Hercules Judge**: Ideal judge interprets law as a coherent whole, fitting principles.
- **Implications**: Blurs separation of law and morality (contra Bentham/Hart, closer to natural law elements).

::: {.notes}
Dworkin argues for interpretive approach, where morality informs legal validity in hard cases.
:::

## Comparison: Hart vs. Dworkin

| Aspect          | Hart (Positivism)                  | Dworkin (Interpretivism)           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Law's Nature    | Rules (primary + secondary)       | Rules + principles                 |
| Validity        | Rule of recognition (pedigree)     | Best fit with moral principles     |
| Hard Cases      | Judicial discretion (open texture) | Principled interpretation          |
| Morality        | Separated from law                 | Integrated into interpretation     |

## Connections to Prior Topics

- **Bentham**: Hart refines utilitarian positivism; Dworkin critiques its moral detachment.
- **Kretzmann**: Dworkin's principles echo natural law's moral criteria.
- **Speluncean Explorers**: Illustrates Hart's rules in action and Dworkin's need for principles.

Ties back for course continuity.

## Discussion Questions

- How does Hart's model address limitations in Bentham's theory?
- In what ways does Dworkin extend or challenge the Speluncean judges' approaches?
- Can unjust laws (per Kretzmann) exist under Hart vs. Dworkin?
