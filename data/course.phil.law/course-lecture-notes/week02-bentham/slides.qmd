# Utilitarian Positivism – Bentham, Principles of Morals and Legislation (Jan 25–30)

Core thesis: Law’s purpose = maximize utility (pleasure – pain); legislation as social engineering.

Key concepts: Principle of utility, hedonic calculus, sovereign commands, separation of law-as-it-is from law-as-it-ought-to-be.

Bridge to next: Bentham = classical positivist foundation for Hart.

## Legal Positivism

John Austin:

> A law, in the most general and comprehensive acceptation in which the term, in its literal meaning, is employed, may be said to be a rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him. [The Province of Jurisprudence Determined, selections from Lectures I and VI, 1832]

But notice Bentham's formulation:

## The Principle of Utility

> Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, *pain*, and *pleasure*.

* Every action either promotes pleasure, or mitigates pain.
* Therefore, we evaluate all action by its ability to promote pleasure or mitigate pain.

---

> An action then may be said to be conformable to the principle of utility, or, for shortness sake, to utility, (meaning with respect to the community at large) when the tendency it has to augment the happiness of the community is greater than any it has to diminish it.

## Of Principles Adverse to that of Utility

Other possible determinates of actions:

* Asceticism
* Principle of Sympathy and Antipathy

---

### Asceticism

Come in Two Kinds

* Moralists
* Religionists

---

* like utility, guise through which we might approve or disapprove actions
* actions that diminish happiness are good, actions that promote pain good
* actions promote happiness are bad, actions that diminish pain are good

---

> By the principle of asceticism I mean that principle, which, like the principle of utility, approves or disapproves of any action, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question; but in an inverse manner: approving of actions in as far as they tend to diminish his happiness; disapproving of them in as far as they tend to augment it. (Principles of Morals and Legislation)

#### Four Sources of Pleasure, Pain, and Sanction

Sources of Pleasures and Pains

1. Physical
2. Political
3. Moral
4. And Religious

---

* Physical pains are often natural, i.e., car accidents.
* But, pains from a judge, sovereign, supreme ruling power are synonymous with political sanction

---

But . . .

> If at the hands of such chance persons in the community, as the party in question may happen in the course of his life to have concerns with, according to each man's spontaneous disposition, and not according to any settled or concerted rule, it may be said to issue from the *moral* or *popular sanction*. [Of Morals, 28]

---

Superior or invisible being, = religious sanction

### Of Human Actions in General

What is the purpose of Government?

> The business of government is to promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding. [61]

Contrast with Aquinas:

* Law = rule and measure of acts whereby man is induced to act or restrained from acting

### But for what?

> Now the first principle in practical matters, which are the object of the practical reason, is the last end, and the last end of human life is bliss or happiness, as stated above. Consdquently, the law must needs regard principally the relationship to happiness. [Aquinas, ST I-II, Q. 90, 2nd]

## Moving On

The proper objectives of law is to promote happiness. This can be found in:

> Concrete manifestations of happiness, for example, may be found in personal security and reduced crime rates, enhanced health and declining death rates, broader opportunities for education, the reduction of diseases caused by sewage pollution, and so on. [@crim26]

### Of the Limits of the Penal Branch of Jurisprudence

What can the law forbid?

Consider:

* Seat belt laws
* Laws against suicide
* Laws against incest

---

Kinds of Legal Matter

* Criminal
* Civil

---

Two kinds of Legislation

* Moral (Private Ethics)
* Civil (Community), Penal (Penalties)

---

How do we distinguish between the limits of law, matters of public and private.

Ethics == the art of directing men's actions to the production of the greatest possible quantify of happiness, on the part of those whose interest is in view.

---

Directing to action = Coercion

> What then are the actions which it can be in a man's power to direct? They must be either his own actions, or those of other agents. Ethics, in as far as it is the art of directing a man's own actions, may be styled the *art of self-government*, or *private ethics*.

* What is coercion?
* Who can be coerced?
* How can they be coerced?

# Exclusive Positivism and Inclusive Positivism

* Rules of recognition
  * determine certain facts or events
  * taken to yield established ways for creating, modifying, and annuling legal standards

### Exclusive Source of Law

> The kind of exclusive positivism I have in mind would baasically hold that legal validity is exhausted by reference to the conventional sources of law: all law is source based, and anything which is not souce based is not laww.

### Inclusive Source of Law

* Law can include considerations of morality

* i.e., Ronald Dworkin "maintains that the dependence of legal validity on moral jconsiderations is an essential feature of law which basically derives from law's profound interpretative nature

## Limits of Civil and Penal Law

* Legislation and Private ethics

### Some preliminaries, II-IV

* Ethics: art of directing men's happiness to the production of the greatest possible quantity of happiness

Two kinds of action:

* His or her own: private ethics, art of self-government
* Those of other agents:

---

>  What other agents then are there, which, at the same time that they are under the influence of man’s direction, are susceptible of happiness. They are of two sorts:

1. Other human beings who are styled persons.

2. Other animals, which, on account of their interests having been neglected by the insensibility of the ancient jurists, stand degraded into the class of things.

### The Art of Government and Private Government (Education)

Who is responsible for directing others toward happiness?

> As to other human beings, the art of directing their actions to the above end is what we mean, or at least, we *ought* to mean, by the art of government: which, in as far as the measures it displays itself in are of
a permanent nature, is generally distinguished by the name of ***legislation***: as it is by that of ***administration***, when they are of a temporary nature, determined by the occurrences of the day.

* education for children
* best administered "in virtue of some ***private*** relationship".
* Private vs. Public education

### Duties and Obligations

* To one's self in the pursuit of happiness
* To other's in ***their*** pursuit of happiness

Obligations depend in part on effects of one's behavior:

* behavior that effects the agent (Prudence)
* behavior which effects someone other than the agent (duty to one's neighbor)

Of that which affects the neighbor, we have:

* Probity, forbearing to diminish another's happiness
* Beneficence, seek to increase another's happiness
  - Selfish motives, love of reputation for self
  - selfless motives sympathy for others

### Both private ethics and legislation

* Directed at happiness
* Happiness of every member

### Where is the difference?

> In that the acts which they ought to be conversant about, though in a great measure, are not perfectly and throughout the same. There is no case in which a private man ought not to direct his own conduct to the production of his own happiness, and of that of his fellow-creatures: but there are cases in which the legislator ought not (in a direct way at least, and by means of punishment applied immediately to particular individual acts) to attempt to direct the conduct of the several other members of the community. Every act which promises to be beneficial upon the whole to the community (himself included) each individual ought to perform of himself: but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to perform. Every act which promises to be pernicious upon the whole to the community (himself included) each individual ought to abstain from of him: but it is not every such act that the legislator ought to compel him to abstain from.

### Positive and Negative Injunctions, Rights and Obligations

> The business is to give an idea of the cases in which ethics ought, and in which legislation ought not (in a direct manner at least) to interfere. If legislation interferes in a direct manner, it must be by punishment. Now the cases in which punishment, meaning the punishment of the political sanction, ought not to be inflicted, have been already stated. [227]

### Four Cases of Punishment

1. Where it would be groundless
2. Where it would be inefficacious
3. Where it would be unprofitable
4. Where it would be needless

---

1. In actions that are not morally wrong
2. Two classes of ineffective laws:
  - Bad timing, *ex-post-facto*
  - Unadvertised law
3. Where the action could not be prevented by a commandment
  - Small children
  - Mental health
  - Inebriation

### When the punishment is more evil than the crime

> 1, The evil of coercion, including constraint or restraint, according as the act commanded is of the positive kind or the negative. 2. The evil of apprehension. 3. The evil of sufferance. 4. The derivative evils resulting to persons in connection with those by whom the three above-mentioned original evils are sustained.

## Subordinate Ends

### Civil Law

* Security
* Subsistence
* Abundance
* Equality

> As we have seen, security is maintained by laws that protect property and the expectations derived from ownership, and uphold the contracts that facilitate the trade in goods and services. Subsistence and abundance are also derived from this source. When an overall abundance exists but not all enjoy the necessary means of subsistence, then legislative intervention may be conducted in accordance with the “disappointment-prevention principle”, such as when the state takes ownership of an estate for which there is no legitimate heir (122–23), or when a tax on income or property can be introduced without materially detracting from a person’s expectations, and the funds accrued used to provide food and basic services to those in need.

### E.g.,

* Post-Feudal Europe
* More equal distribution of property
* Slow progress towards equality

### However

> The important caveat Bentham introduced to justify his optimism is the proviso that government must not impede this tendency by allowing monopolies, putting “shackles” on trade and industry, or placing obstacles in the path of the division of property on inheritance. [@crim26]

Not strictly wealth redistribution:

* No monopolies but . . . No shackles on trade and industry
* Free division of property / inheritance

---

> Bentham believed that facilitating individuals in the pursuit of their interests in a free market is what government should do, because this is the proven best way to maximise the public good. Where laissez-faire does not produce the best result, however, the legislator must act in other direct and indirect ways to produce the optimal outcome. [@crim26]

### Penal Law

* Directed at deterrence
* Moral Reformation
* Compensation
* Must be appropriate between crimes and punishments
