### Presentation (15% of final grade, 96 points):

For this portion of the grade, we will conduct a series of dnd advantures modeled on hard to solve philosophical problems. For instance, in Plato's Republic, Plato uses the thought of a cave holding prisoners who've never seen the outside. All the things they think are objects in the world, really are just crude imitations projected onto a wall in front of them. One escapes and realizes everything he's been told is a lie. If he goes back, no one will believe him, what should he do?

| Sunlight Revelation (Books VI-VII, Cave Allegory) | You reach the exit: Blinding sun! Puppets were lies. Return to free others? They mock you as mad. | - Question: "Forms vs. shadows—what's real?" (Insight roll: 15+ → Vision quest boon; Low → Blinded retreat.) - Suggestion: "Descend as educators." (Strength roll: Success → Convert prisoners; Fail → Stoned as heretic.) - Others: Resistance rolls → "Allegory boss": High total → Party ascends enlightened. |
