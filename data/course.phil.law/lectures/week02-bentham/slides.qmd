# The Nature of Law

## Initial Interpretation

1. Laws == State's System of Justice.
2. Sometimes private citizens decide a particular state law is unjust.
3. Natural law: there is some rule of measurement external to the state's system of justice.

## The Question

> Is an individual citizen entitled or obliged to decide whether a law of the state is unjust? If so, on what grounds is he or she supposed to make the decision?

---

* What is the rule of measurement the individual citizen uses?
* Does the individual citizen get to decide?
* Is the individual citizen obliged to decide?
* What can she do if a given law is unjust?

> And if an individual citizen has decided on appropriate grounds that a law of the state is unjust, what is she or he entitled or obliged to do about it? [@kret88, 7]
