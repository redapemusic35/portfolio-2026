# What are legal rights and obligations?

Legal obligation is determined by applying "the law" to the facts of the case

* But what is the law?
* Why are we concerned with what the law "says"?
* Does the law determine our obligations or merely point to our obligations?
* If it only points to our obligations, than what are our obligations rooted in?
* What then, are our legal obligations ultimately grounded in?
