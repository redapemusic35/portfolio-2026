***Essays 2 (80 points each):***

* Your paper should consist of two distinct parts. The first part, which should account for approximately half the length of the paper, should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments.

* The second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be proffered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond.

* If you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay. I will provide a more detailed account in class.
