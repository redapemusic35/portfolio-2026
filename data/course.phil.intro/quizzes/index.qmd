***Quizzes 1 & 2 (80 points):*** Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.

Each of the scheduled examinations will cover lectures, discussions and assigned readings from the classes that precede it. You are responsible for assigned readings without regard to whether they were covered in class. The final examination will focus primarily on the lectures, discussions and readings subsequent to the first examination, but it may cover material from the whole semester. I generally do not give makeup examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class.
