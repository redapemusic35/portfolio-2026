# D&D Campaigns

***Presentation (96 points):*** Your grade in this area depends on your preparation and participation in the DND class meetings. [We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZAXxdpvv5jzylj8_18jXUTI68o9MLrXw?usp=sharing).

## Overall Assignment Setup

* ***Group Structure:*** By second week, students form small groups of ***5 members*** each. This will be done using a randomizing method.
* ***Rotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role:*** Every group member gets ***one turn*** to act as the Dungeon Master (DM) for a full session/day.
  * This distributes the workload fairly---no one is stuck doing all the prep.
  * The DM takes ownership of that day's reading/topic. A D&D-style adventure will be provided for the class and the DM will be given the adventure. They then give the problems to the other students in a turn-based format.
  * The DM will role a d20 dice first to determine what positions the students will take.

## Session Format (When a Student is DM)

### 1. Presentation of the Reading

The DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).

* The core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.
* The reading is the "quest" or "dungeon" backdrop---e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).

### 2. Challenges Presented One at a Time

The DM introduces ***several challenges*** sequentially

* Each challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.
* Examples:
  * You've created an intelligent and conscious sim population $\rightarrow$ Debate your obligations to them.
  * You've fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character $\rightarrow$ Explore is this true love?

### 3. Group Interaction & Participation

For each ***challenge***:

* any group member can respond by:
  * ***Asking a clarifying question*** about the challenge (probing the text/concept).
  * ***Offering a suggestion/solution*** (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).
* The DM evaluates the response (as the "world" reacting).
  * The responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.
  * Success means attacking the position
  * Failure means defending the position

### 4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls

After the first response/roll:

* Otehr group member get turns to ***offer their own responses*** or build on/counter the previous one.
* They also ***roll dice*** to suggest "other considerations" (e.g., other defenses of the DM's positions; other criticism's of the DM's position; edge cases; objections from the reading)
* This creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes---mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.

### 5. Resolution & Reflection

* The DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)
* The session ends with debrief: How did the "adventure" illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?
