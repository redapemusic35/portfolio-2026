## Welcome to Introduction to Philosophy

A primary objective of this course is to teach students how to construct good arguments and how to assess the arguments of others. In order to accomplish this goal, during the first part of the semester we will read about and discuss what makes a particular argument good or bad and practice constructing good arguments. In addition, we will discuss knowledge and scientific inquiry as this will help us to understand the importance of methodological thought and speech.

A second objective is to provide an introduction to philosophy. We will read and discuss a variety of philosophical theories (I understand you may not yet know what I mean by the term *philosophical theory*) and apply these theories to one strange issue: whether or not we are simulations. We will be looking at this issue through several important philosophical questions, if we are a simulation, what is real?, if we are a simulation, how would we know?, if we are a simulation, would our values be different? We will not only look at contemporary issues about ai and sim theory, but will also look at how philosophers of the past posed and attempted to answer this question. Significantly, when we discuss ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. In doing, we will apply what we learned about argumentation during the first part of the semester.

In this course, we will use David Chalmer's book ***Reality+*** to look at questions humans have been asking for thousands of years. While the primary focus of the book is look at one question in particular "Are we in a simulation?", we use this question to frame others such as those above.
