# The Problem of the External World

## The *(very silly)* Evolutionary Argument from Naturalism (EAAN)

::: {.r-fit-text}

* Philosophical Naturalism (N):
  * There are no supernatural beings (i.e., God, angeles, demons, ghosts)
* Contemporary Evolutionary Theory (E)
  * Human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine

* Naturalism and Evolutionary theory are at odds with one another.
  * I.e., if philosophical naturalism is true, then contemporary evolutionary theory can't be true.
  * If Contemporary evolutionary theory is true, then naturalism cannot be true.

Therefore, either E is true, or N is true, but not both.

## Reliability of Cognitive Faculties

* Memory
* Perception
* Reason

We often ground a good majority of our beliefs in these faculties and more.

As such, these faculties are reliable if the majority of our beliefs that are grounded in them are true.

However,

according to E:

* human life developed from aboriginal unicellular life
  * natural selection
  * genetic drift
  * genetic variation (random genetic mutatation)
* Natural selection discards most mutations
  * Some mutations have adaptive value
  * some do not
* Through such processes, most if not all organic life as developed

:::

---

* Through such processes, our cognitive faculties too, have evolved
* But natural selection is not interested in truth but rather adaptive behavior, the four Fs:
  * Feeding,
  * Fleeing,
  * Fighting
  * Reproducing
* It is possible that some other function has proved more adaptive
* Therefore we cannot be sure we can trust our faculties to be reliable

For instance, here is Charles Darwin on the matter:

> the horrid doubt always arises whether the convictions of man's mind, which has been developed from the mind of the lower animals, are of any value or at all trutworthy. Would any one trust in the convictions of a monkey's mind, if there are any convictions in such a mind? [Letter to William Graham, Down, July 3, 1881, in The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin INcluding an Autobiographical Chapter, ed. Francis Darwin (London: John Murray, Albermarle Street, 1887), I:315-316.]

Here is Patricia Churchland:

> Boiled down to essentials, a nervous system enables the organism to succeed in the four F's: fedding, fleeing, fighting and reproducing. The principle chore of nervous systems is the get the body parts where they should be in order that the organism may survive . . . Improvements in sensorimotor control confer an evolutionary advantage: a fancier style of representing is advantageous so long as it is geared to the organism's way of life and enhances the organism's chances of survival. Truth, whatever that is, definitely takes the hindmost. [Churchland, "Epistemology in the Age of Neuroscience," Journal of Philosophy 84 (October 1987): 548]

## Descartes

> Certainly, up to now whatever I have accepted as fully true I have learned either from or by means of the senses: but I have discovered that they sometimes deceive us, and prudence dictataes that we should never fully trust those who have deceived us even once.

## Berkeley

## G.E. Moore

## Alvin Plantinga
