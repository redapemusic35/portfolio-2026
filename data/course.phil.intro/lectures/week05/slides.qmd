# Sims

* From the inside, *SimUniverse* will be indistinguishable from the univere it is a simulation of.
* Simulation of universe contains 10 billion people, one for each person in the actual universe.
* Say that it is a very popular program, then millions if not billions may have *SimUniverse* on their devices.
* Therefore, there will be many more sims than non sims.

# What is happening in this Chapter?!

## Questions Philosophers Ask

* What is Real?
* How do we know it is real?
* Why should we care?

---

* Metaphysics
* Epistemology
* Value Theory

---

But notice that it is not just about providing answers to questions. Sometimes it is how we provide an answer that is even more interesting.

---

Consider:

![](../../../readings/poss-necc.png)

---

There are two very important terms here:

* If so, then we are *probably sims*
* It will *never* happen

---

One is a special kind of possibility, while the other entails a necessity.

---

The Argument:

1. At least one in ten nonsim populations will each create a thousand sim populations.
2. If at least one in ten nonsim populations will each create a thousand sim populations, then at least 99 percent of intelligent beings are sims.
3. If at least 99 percent of intelligent beings are sims, we are *probably* sims.
4. Therefore, we are *probably* sims.

## Nick Bostrom

At least one of the following propositions is true (a proposition is a statement that is either true or false)

1. The human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage;
2. Any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof);
3. We are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.

---

1 and 2 are sim blockers:

1. Nonsims (humans) likely to go extinct before creating nonsims.
2. Nonsims likely to choose not to create sims.

# Strong vs. Weak Verificationism

By now, as before, you may be criticizing the:

![](../../../readings/transcendence-ayer.png)

---

1. We normally rely on our senses for evidence
2. But Bostrom's argument does not rely on his senses
3. How then does he arrive at his conclusion?

---

You are probably used to the following inference patters:

1. Some experience, there is water falling on my face.
2. Some belief / conclusion, it is raining today.

---

Your counter looks like this:

![](../../../readings/empirical-ayer.png)

---

1. 1 by 1 nonsim sim populations?
2. SimUniverses populated by a intelligent sims?
3. It certainly looks like 1 and 2 are super empirical (beyond sense experience).

---

Here, Ayer agrees with you:

![](../../../readings/denial-ayer.png)

---

But this also means:

1. We need a new criterion of meaning
2. A formal syntax

> Philosophy of logic is devoted to the investigation, analysis and reflection on issues arising in logic, while philosophical logic concerns questions about reference, truth, quantification, existence, entailment, predication, identity, modality, and necessity. A typical example of philosophical logic is the application of formal logical techniques to philosophical problems. [PhilPapers Logic Entry](https://philpapers.org/browse/logic-and-philosophy-of-logic)

---

Here are those words again:

> But it is verifiable in the weak sense, if it is *possible* for experience to render it *probable*.

# Summary of Chapter 5

## Simulation Argument

1. Simulation technology is likely to be so ubiquitous that most beings in the universe (or most beings with experiences like ours) are sims.
2. Therefore, we are probably sims.

## Three Objections:

* It will never happen
* We're special, have special features that cannot be simulated
* We live in a distinctive world

## The Argument

1. At least one in ten nonsim populations will each create a thousand sim populations.
   1. It will never happen objections
2. If at least one in ten nonsim populations will each create a thousand sim populations, then at least 99 percent of intelligent beings are sims.
3. If at least 99 percent of intelligent beings are sims, we are probably sims.
   1. are we special?
4. Therefore, we are probably sims.

## Premise 1 Objections

* Intelligent sims are impossible
* Sims take too much computing power
* Nonsims will die out before creating sims
* Nonsims will choose not to create sims
* More nonsims than sims will be created

## Premise 3, Are we special?

> Let’s say that a sim sign is a feature that raises the probability that a creature is a sim. More precisely, it is a feature that a sim is more likely to have than a nonsim.

Sim Signs: feature sims are more likely to have than nonsims

* Sims can't be conscious
* Simulators will avoid creating conscious sims
* Sims won't have minds like ours
* Sims won't experience large universes

---

> Stepping back: The potential nonsim signs we’ve considered, such as consciousness and a large world, may decrease the probability that we’re in a simulation. At the same time, we need to weigh these against potential sim signs, such as the fact that we seem to be early in the universe, which may increase the probability that we’re in a simulation.

# Bostrom's Argument

1. If there are no sim blockers, most humanlike beings are sims.
2. If most humanlike beings are sims, we are probably sims.
3. So: If there are no sim blockers, we are probably sims.

## Premise 1

Only on the assumption that there are no sim blockers, then *most* humanlike beings are sims.

* Does anything *prevent* the creation of many humanlike sims?

## Premise 2, the Indifference Principle

1. If there are many beings with the same sort of experience as me, then I am equally likely to be any of those beings.
2. Therefore if 90 percent of beings with experiences like mine are sims, then I should be 90 percent confident that we are sims.
3. Simblockers: However, if conscious sims are impossible, then humanlike sims are impossible.
4. and if simulations with apparently large universes are rare, then humanlike sims are rare.
5. Therefore, either there are sim blockers or we are sims.
