# Chapter 6: Reality

Consider simblockers

* Sims can't be conscious
* Simulators will avoid creating conscious sims
* Sims won't have minds like ours
* Sims won't experience large universes

## What is Real?

Chalmer's View:

* Virtual Realism: virtual reality is genuine reality, . . . virtual objects are real and not an illusion.
* Simulation Realism: objects in simulation around us are real and not illusion.
* Virtual digitilism: objects in virtual reality are digital objects, structures of binary information.

## Defining Real

* Reality: Everything that exists
* Reality: World or Worlds
* Reality: a Property

### Reality+

* Reality contains many realities
* Each of these realities are real

> Or more mundanely: the cosmos (everything that exists) contains many worlds (physical and virtual spaces), and the objects in those worlds are real.

# The Really Real

* Reality as existence
* Reality as causal power
* Reality as mind independence
* Reality as non-illusoriness
* Reality as genuineness
