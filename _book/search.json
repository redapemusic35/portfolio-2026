    "text": "Welcome to Introduction to Philosophy\nA primary objective of this course is to teach students how to construct good arguments and how to assess the arguments of others. In order to accomplish this goal, during the first part of the semester we will read about and discuss what makes a particular argument good or bad and practice constructing good arguments. In addition, we will discuss knowledge and scientific inquiry as this will help us to understand the importance of methodological thought and speech.\nA second objective is to provide an introduction to philosophy. We will read and discuss a variety of philosophical theories (I understand you may not yet know what I mean by the term philosophical theory) and apply these theories to one strange issue: whether or not we are simulations. We will be looking at this issue through several important philosophical questions, if we are a simulation, what is real?, if we are a simulation, how would we know?, if we are a simulation, would our values be different? We will not only look at contemporary issues about ai and sim theory, but will also look at how philosophers of the past posed and attempted to answer this question. Significantly, when we discuss ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. In doing, we will apply what we learned about argumentation during the first part of the semester.\nIn this course, we will use David Chalmer’s book Reality+ to look at questions humans have been asking for thousands of years. While the primary focus of the book is look at one question in particular “Are we in a simulation?”, we use this question to frame others such as those above.",

I will only grade 8 or your best reflections for a possible total of 32 points.\nEach week on Wednesday (except Aug. 19th, August 26th, Oct 14th, Nov 25th, Dec 2nd, Dec 9th) a short weekly will be due, (just the front and back of a 3x5 note card). Weeklies will be based on the assigned readings and/or the discussion from the previous class. Each weekly is worth 7 points (maximum), and I will assign a total of 11 weeklies. I will drop the three lowest scored weeklies. Since I include in your total paper grade 11 weeklies at 10 points per weekly, the total points possible on weeklies is 110. If you should earn more than one hundred points on weeklies, all additional points count as extra credit. Finally, since the weekly is due at the beginning of class, arriving to class on time is essential. I will not accept the weekly after 5 minutes from the start of class. If you arrive late or are absent, you receive a zero for the weekly. I do give partial credit for weeklies, and just putting your name on the top is worth one point. (It would be best if you purchase a set of 3x5 note cards to right your weekly on.) The purpose of these weeklies is to help me assess how e↵ectively I am going over the material. As such, what I am looking for is a short/ concise exposition of either the reading or of the discussion from the week before. I will let you know which when I assign the weekly on the Monday prior.\nQuizzes 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\n\nYour paper should consist of two distinct parts. The first part, which should account for approximately half the length of the paper, should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments.\nThe second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be proffered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond.\nIf you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay. I will provide a more detailed account in class.\n\n\nCritical Reflections\nCritical Reflection 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\n\n\nD&D Campaigns\nThe D&D assignment is not exactly like D&D though Ive tried to keep it as close as possible. The idea is to encourage students to talk through the philosophical issues we read about.\nPresentation (96 points): Your grade in this area depends on your preparation and participation in the DND class meetings. We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation.\n\nOverall Assignment Setup\n\nGroup Structure: By second week, students form small groups of 5 members each. This will be done using a randomizing method.\nRotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role: Every group member gets one turn to act as the Dungeon Master (DM) for a full session/day.\n\nThis distributes the workload fairly—no one is stuck doing all the prep.\nThe DM takes ownership of that day’s reading/topic. A D&D-style adventure will be provided for the class and the DM will be given the adventure. They then give the problems to the other students in a turn-based format. Ideally you begin by imagining being in a unique situation that makes you question some belief that you’ve always taken for granted, an example will be provided which you may use instead of creating your own.\nThe DM will role a d20 dice first to determine what positions the students will take.\n\n\n\n\nPlay Through\nThe D&D assignment is not exactly like D&D though Ive tried to keep it as close as possible. The idea is to encourage students to talk through the philosophical issues we read about.\nIdeally you begin by imagining being in a unique situation that makes you question some belief that you’ve always taken for granted.\nEach day that we do the activity, each group will have a new DM for that day. The DM rolls the dice to set the difficulty class. They then read the encounter.\n\nThere are billions of people (non sims) in the actual universe.\nTherefore there will be billions of sim people in the sim universe.\nSuch a program, the simUniverse, will likely be very successful and there will be many, many simUniverses sold.\n\nTherefore there will be many more sims than non sims.\n\n\nEncounter\nThe DM then reads an imagined context that motivates each of the reasons above in a turn based format.\nGoing around the table, the DM has each member of their group roll a d20 to determine what position on one of the reasons above, they are going to take. Do they defend the reason given, or do they critique it?\nFirst, as a class we take three polls, one for each reason. Is there more who agree with the reason above, or disagree with it?\nNext,\n\nThe DM rolls a dice and gets 10.\n\nWinning roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls higher, they get to defend the intuitive position.\nThis is whichever position there is most agreement for.\n\nLosing roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls lower than the DM, then they will have to defend the least likely answer.\nThe position with the least agreement for.\n\nThe students gives their position which is recorded onto everyone’s tally sheets. At the end of the campaign for that day, each sheet should have a set of positions for each of the reasons above, either defending it, or objecting to it, one from each member of the group.\nEveryone should have their own copy of the tally sheet. You will upload a photo of it to Canvas under the assignment module. You keep the tally sheet for the entire semester.",

The final examination will focus primarily on the lectures, discussions and readings subsequent to the first examination, but it may cover material from the whole semester. I generally do not give makeup examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class.\nEssays 2 (80 points each):\n\nYour paper should consist of two distinct parts.

We will use the dnd adventure sheet linked here to gage participation.\nThe DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided). The core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance. The reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially. Each challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading. Examples: You’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them. You’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\nFor each challenge any group member can respond by: Asking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept). Offering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter). The DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting). The responding player rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\n\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\nAfter the first response/roll: Each person’s response will be based on whether they win or loose the dice roll. Other group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one. They also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading). This creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\nResolution & Reflection occurs when the DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?). The session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy? Did you change your original position?\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned.

Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy.\nThe honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use.
