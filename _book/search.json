    "text": "1 About\nI am a philosopher and educator who is deeply passionate about leveraging artificial intelligence and interactive storytelling to enhance human reasoning, productivity, ethical decision-making, and overall flourishing—particularly for underserved youth. In 2024, I obtained a PhD in Philosophy from Saint Louis University. Now, with a small team, build and integrate AI-driven tools—such as D&D campaign generators and develop massively multiplayer online game environments—into educational platforms that foster critical thinking, moral imagination, and empathy. As Founder and Director of the Saleno Center for Human Flourishing, I lead initiatives that explore how digital narratives and games can counter harmful stereotypes, promote moral well-being, and guide users toward more thoughtful, connected lives. I am currently serving as Visiting Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Stetson University, where I teach courses in logic, aesthetics, philosophy of law, and introduction to philosophy. I am currently developing courses in the philosophy of mind and personhood. I always emphasizing real-world applications, collaboration, and rigorous ethical reflection. My work, including forthcoming publications like Moral Autonomy and Personhood in Pop Culture, draws on narrative ethics to show how fiction and interactive media can cultivate affective moral understanding and support more examined, meaningful existence.",

The student, course instructor and Academic Success will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Academic Integrity - DO NOT CHEAT. As a member of Stetson University, I agree to uphold the highest standards of integrity in my academic work. I promise that I will neither give nor receive unauthorized aid of any kind on my tests, papers, and assignments. When using the ideas, thoughts, or words of another in my work, I will always provide clear acknowledgement of the individuals and sources on which I am relying. I will avoid using fraudulent, falsified, or fabricated evidence and/or material. I will refrain from resubmitting without authorization work for one class that was obtained from work previously submitted for academic credit in another class. I will not destroy, steal, or make inaccessible any academic resource material. By my actions and my example, I will strive to promote the ideals of honesty, responsibility, trust, fairness, and respect that are at the heart of Stetson’s Honor System. Cheating violates university regulations and is a reportable offense that may result in academic suspension or dismissal from Stetson University. Every violation of the Honor System will be promptly reported to the Honor System Council for further investigation. In addition to these academic integrity standards, I expect students to treat everyone in the classroom—the instructor, fellow students, and guests—with common courtesy and respect.",

    "section": "Evaluated Activities",
    "text": "Evaluated Activities\nWeekly Reflections (32 points): These will be done each week in class. Each reflection is worth a possible total of 8 points. There are 12 possible reflections. I will only grade 8 or your best reflections for a possible total of 32 points.\nEach week on Wednesday (except Aug. 19th, August 26th, Oct 14th, Nov 25th, Dec 2nd, Dec 9th) a short weekly will be due, (just the front and back of a 3x5 note card). Weeklies will be based on the assigned readings and/or the discussion from the previous class. Each weekly is worth 7 points (maximum), and I will assign a total of 11 weeklies. I will drop the three lowest scored weeklies. Since I include in your total paper grade 11 weeklies at 10 points per weekly, the total points possible on weeklies is 110. If you should earn more than one hundred points on weeklies, all additional points count as extra credit. Finally, since the weekly is due at the beginning of class, arriving to class on time is essential. I will not accept the weekly after 5 minutes from the start of class. If you arrive late or are absent, you receive a zero for the weekly. I do give partial credit for weeklies, and just putting your name on the top is worth one point. (It would be best if you purchase a set of 3x5 note cards to right your weekly on.) The purpose of these weeklies is to help me assess how e↵ectively I am going over the material. As such, what I am looking for is a short/ concise exposition of either the reading or of the discussion from the week before. I will let you know which when I assign the weekly on the Monday prior.\nQuizzes 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nEach of the scheduled examinations will cover lectures, discussions and assigned readings from the classes that precede it. You are responsible for assigned readings without regard to whether they were covered in class. The final examination will focus primarily on the lectures, discussions and readings subsequent to the first examination, but it may cover material from the whole semester. I generally do not give makeup examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class.\nCritical Reflection 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nYou will be required to write one paper, which must be type-written, double-spaced, and six to eight pages in length. This is NOT a research paper. Below are several topics, each student must choose ONE to which s/he will respond. If you wish to write a paper on a topic other than one of those suggested by me contact me after class and we can make an appointment during my office hours to discuss other topics. (I will be more than happy to approve relevant topics.) The papers you write are not opinion papers. It is standard practice among philosophers to view mere opinion to be worth less than the energy used to express it. What is worthwhile is a reasoned defense of one’s opinion. Your paper should be written so as to present rational argument for the position which you hold.\nYour paper should consist of two distinct parts. The first part, which should account for approximately half the length of the paper, should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments. The second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be pro↵ered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond. If you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay. I will provide a more detailed account in class.\n\nD&D Campaigns (96 points total)\n\nOverview & Purpose\nYour grade in this area is based on preparation and active participation during D&D-style class meetings. The format uses a simplified, philosophy-focused adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons to encourage students to talk through, debate, and critically engage with the philosophical issues in the assigned readings — not just summarize or repeat them.\nThe core idea: Turn abstract philosophical texts into immersive, narrative “quests” or “dungeons” where the reading provides the backdrop (e.g., a moral dilemma in a kingdom, a metaphysical riddle from an adversarial entity, or an epistemological challenge). This creates lively discussion, risk, uncertainty, and stakes via dice rolls — mirroring real philosophical debate.\n\n\nKey Differences from Traditional D&D\nThis is not full tabletop RPG gameplay (no complex combat, character stats, or long campaigns). It is a structured, turn-based discussion tool designed to make philosophy feel urgent, personal, and collaborative. Overall Assignment Setup\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Schedule\nAdjust all dates by one for Tuesday Thursday Course\nWeeklies Due Every Monday Starting Jan 19\nWed Jan 14, handouts\nMon Jan 19 MLK Day, no classes\nWed Jan 21, Chapter 2, Simulation Hypothesis\nMon Jan 26, Chapter 3, Knowledge\nWed Jan 28, The external world, ch. 4\nMon Feb 2, ch. 5, Possible realities, bostrom and Moravec\nWed Feb 4, ch. 6, What is Reality?\nMon Fed 9, ch. 7, Is God a hacker in the universe up?\nWed Fed 11, ch. 8 Information, 2nd DND Adventure, Student Led\nMon Feb 16, ch. 9, On Bits\nWed Feb 18, ch. 10, Reality and Virtual Reality\nMon Feb 23, ch. 11, Illusion Machines\nWed Feb 25, Quiz 1\nMon Mar 02, Spring Break\nWed Mar 4, Spring Break\nMon Mar 9, ch. 13 ch. 12, 3rd DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 11, ch. 14, Mind and body Realism inside a virtual universe\nMon Mar 16, ch. 15, 4th DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 18, ch. 16, The extended mind hypothsis\nMon Mar 23, ch. 17 Critical Reflection Due\nWed Mar 25, ch. 18, Virtual ethics and intentiality\nMon Mar 30, ch. 19, Social Ontology inside virtual worlds\nWed Apr 1, ch. 20, 5th DND Adventure on Sense and Reference, Student Led\nMon Apr 6, ch. 21, Cause and effect inside virtual systems\nWed Apr 8, ch. 22, Mathematical, physical and cultural structualism\nMon Apr 13, ch. 23, Virtual Eden?\nWed Apr 15, ch. 24, Brains in a Vat\nMon Apr 20, TBD\nWed Apr 22, TBD\nMon Apr 27, TBD\nWed Apr 29, last day of classes, Final Quiz\nPaper Due on Day of Final Quiz (Submit on Canvas)",

This course builds on that idea by treating massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) like Star Citizen as interactive laboratories for philosophy. Here, virtual worlds become testing grounds for real moral and ethical questions: Is it better to pursue a humble career like cargo hauling, or chase quick gains through piracy? Students will apply concepts from key thinkers (e.g., Aristotle on virtues, Rawls on justice) to in-game dilemmas, improving critical reasoning via a cycle of choice, consequence, and argument. Through primary text engagements in debriefs and written reflections on their character’s journey, participants will explore how interactive art shapes character, relationships, and a sense of higher purpose.",

    "text": "GRADING POLICY\nNote: ALL LABORATORY SESSIONS MUST BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED INCLUDING THE IN-GAME ACTIVITIES, DEBRIEFS, AND WRITTEN REFLECTIONS IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A PASSING GRADE IN PHILO LAB: PHILOSOPHICAL LABORATORY.\nEach laboratory session will be graded on the basis of quality of the in-game participation and the reflection. The TA responsible for that session will grade the work. Your TA should discuss the comments and evaluations with you. Questions, suggestions, comments, and complaints not handled by the TA’s should be directed to the Instructor.\nAll session reflections, which have been graded, are returned to you with a date stamped on the cover sheet. Please take time to check the total score, and to look at the comments made by the TA.\nYou have SEVEN (7) calendar days from the TA return date stamped on the cover sheet to request any review of the grading of your reflection—this does not apply to reflections turned in late. This request should go first to the TA responsible for the grade and then if a question related to grading remains the course Instructor. After seven days from TA return date, no reflection will be accepted for change of an incorrectly added score or any re-evaluation. If your reflection is re-graded, it is your responsibility to check the course website grade book to verify that your grade has been updated on your Philo Lab grade record. Similarly, you have 24 hours from the TA posting of grades from a Debrief to request any review of the grading of your participation. You must request a review for a Debrief grade via email to the TA with a copy to the course Instructor. After 24 hours, Debrief grades are considered final.\n\nGrading policy:\nFinal Grade = max. 500\nA. Laboratory Session Grade:\n100 points per session\n\nLab Quiz (check the lab schedule; closed book ~15 min.) 20 points\nPre-lab preparation. 5 points It is essential that you understand the session while you mentally process what you have read. Write in your lab notebook a couple paragraphs on the purpose, philosophical themes, and any anticipated ethical dilemmas or insights of the session. The procedure to perform the session can be found in the Laboratory Manual which you are allowed to bring with you to the lab.\nThe factual record. 5 points Data, procedure signed and dated. It is important to develop good habits in keeping a notebook, including notes on in-game choices, consequences, and initial arguments.\nThe Staff’s assessment of technique, deportment, safety, etc. 5 points\nLab Reflection (written) 65 points This includes points for correct application of philosophical concepts and quality of ethical analysis. The major part of the grade for the Lab Reflection is based on the analysis, interpretation and quality of the results, as well as the arguments, connections to primary texts, and the discussion sections. The Lab Reflection should demonstrate what you learned from the session and your ability to interpret and explain your experiential results. No grade for a session will be given without the laboratory reflection.\n\n\n\nGrading Scale\n100% – 97% A+ 96.9% – 93% A 92.9% – 90% A- 89.9% – 87% B+ 86.9% – 83% B 82.9% – 80% B- 79.9% – 77% C+ 76.9% – 73% C 72.9% – 70% C- 69.9% – 67% D+ 66.9% – 63% D 62.9% – 60% D- 59.9% and less F\nThe grading scale is carefully defined above so that there are no questions at the end of the course. We use the attendance records in the case of borderline grades that fall within half point of a higher grade. The way the attendance works is we calculate up the total number of sessions that attendance was taken in. We then credit each student with two absences in case a student was sick or accidently missed a session. If you have attended all of the required sessions less two then, if your grade is within half point of a higher grade we will round the grade up to the next higher grade. If you did not attend the specified number of sessions your grade will remain unchanged. Missing sessions and not attending class will not lower your grade but can and does help students that fall within half point of a higher grade. If your grade is above 96.9 and below 97.0 say 96.95 then in those cases only, your grade would be automatically rounded to the next higher grade.\n\n\nDetails of the Laboratory Session Grade\nLaboratory Quizzes (20 points) There will be five lab quizzes during the semester. The quizzes will be given in the laboratory on the days indicated in the schedule. Any topic related to the theory, procedure, lecture, analysis and philosophical themes of the session may be quizzed. The emphasis will be on the lab manual and application of information from the morning lectures.\nIF YOU MISS A LAB QUIZ DUE TO AN EXCUSED ABSENCE FROM LAB REQUESTED PRIOR TO THE QUIZ DATE, SCHEDULE A MAKE-UP QUIZ WITH YOUR TA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. If you skip lab on the day of a quiz without notifying both the TA and Instructor at least a day in advance, you will receive a zero grade for that quiz.",
