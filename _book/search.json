Students who take a philosophy course will develop their capacity to (I.) understand and interpret philosophical texts, (II.) identify arguments, (III.) critically assess arguments, (IV.) identify philosophical traditions and methods, (IV.) and/or communicate clearly and effectively. The philosophy department’s five Learning Outcomes are arranged hierarchically, so that the later Learning Outcomes presuppose some familiarity with the lower-order skills. The assignments and work within a given course are expected to develop the skills associated with that course’s PLO, while strengthening the lower- order skills and setting the stage for the development of the higher- order skills. The PLO associated with this course is:\n\nArgumentation: Students can identify and evaluate argument structures effectively.\n\nInformation about the philosophy department’s PLOs can be found at:\nhttp://www.stetson.edu/artsci/philosophy/curriculummap.php",

Gollancz, 1936.\n\nFor, if I am right, it will also follow that any sentence, whether of the English or any other language, that is equivalent to s can be validly derived, in the language in question, from any sentence that is equivalent to r; and it this that my use of the word “proposition” indicates.

If you suspect an inference pattern is unreliable, find an instance which has to be invalid because it has true premises and a false conclusion.\n\nSome F are G; no G is H; so, some F are not H.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\nWhich of the following arguments are valid? Where an argument is valid, sketch an informal proof. Some of the examples are enthymemes that need repair.\n\nOnly logicians are good philosophers. No existentialists are logicians. Some existentialists are French philosophers. So, some French philosophers are not good philosophers.\nNo philosopher is illogical. Jones keeps making argumentative mistakes.

    "text": "Welcome to Introduction to Philosophy\nA primary objective of this course is to teach students how to construct good arguments and how to assess the arguments of others. In order to accomplish this goal, during the first part of the semester we will read about and discuss what makes a particular argument good or bad and practice constructing good arguments. In addition, we will discuss knowledge and scientific inquiry as this will help us to understand the importance of methodological thought and speech.\nA second objective is to provide an introduction to philosophy. We will read and discuss a variety of philosophical theories (I understand you may not yet know what I mean by the term philosophical theory) and apply these theories to one strange issue: whether or not we are simulations. We will be looking at this issue through several important philosophical questions, if we are a simulation, what is real?, if we are a simulation, how would we know?, if we are a simulation, would our values be different? We will not only look at contemporary issues about ai and sim theory, but will also look at how philosophers of the past posed and attempted to answer this question. Significantly, when we discuss ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. In doing, we will apply what we learned about argumentation during the first part of the semester.\nIn this course, we will use David Chalmer’s book Reality+ to look at questions humans have been asking for thousands of years. While the primary focus of the book is look at one question in particular “Are we in a simulation?”, we use this question to frame others such as those above.",

    "section": "Evaluated Activities",
    "text": "Evaluated Activities\nWeekly Reflections (32 points): These will be done each week in class. Each reflection is worth a possible total of 8 points. There are 12 possible reflections. I will only grade 8 or your best reflections for a possible total of 32 points.\nEach week on Wednesday (except Aug. 19th, August 26th, Oct 14th, Nov 25th, Dec 2nd, Dec 9th) a short weekly will be due, (just the front and back of a 3x5 note card). Weeklies will be based on the assigned readings and/or the discussion from the previous class. Each weekly is worth 7 points (maximum), and I will assign a total of 11 weeklies. I will drop the three lowest scored weeklies. Since I include in your total paper grade 11 weeklies at 10 points per weekly, the total points possible on weeklies is 110. If you should earn more than one hundred points on weeklies, all additional points count as extra credit. Finally, since the weekly is due at the beginning of class, arriving to class on time is essential. I will not accept the weekly after 5 minutes from the start of class. If you arrive late or are absent, you receive a zero for the weekly. I do give partial credit for weeklies, and just putting your name on the top is worth one point. (It would be best if you purchase a set of 3x5 note cards to right your weekly on.) The purpose of these weeklies is to help me assess how e↵ectively I am going over the material. As such, what I am looking for is a short/ concise exposition of either the reading or of the discussion from the week before. I will let you know which when I assign the weekly on the Monday prior.\nQuizzes 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nEach of the scheduled examinations will cover lectures, discussions and assigned readings from the classes that precede it. You are responsible for assigned readings without regard to whether they were covered in class. The final examination will focus primarily on the lectures, discussions and readings subsequent to the first examination, but it may cover material from the whole semester. I generally do not give makeup examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class.\nCritical Reflection 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nYou will be required to write one paper, which must be type-written, double-spaced, and six to eight pages in length. This is NOT a research paper. Below are several topics, each student must choose ONE to which s/he will respond. If you wish to write a paper on a topic other than one of those suggested by me contact me after class and we can make an appointment during my office hours to discuss other topics. (I will be more than happy to approve relevant topics.) The papers you write are not opinion papers. It is standard practice among philosophers to view mere opinion to be worth less than the energy used to express it. What is worthwhile is a reasoned defense of one’s opinion. Your paper should be written so as to present rational argument for the position which you hold.\nYour paper should consist of two distinct parts. The first part, which should account for approximately half the length of the paper, should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments. The second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be pro↵ered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond. If you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay. I will provide a more detailed account in class.\n\nD&D Campaigns (96 points total)\n\nOverview & Purpose\nYour grade in this area is based on preparation and active participation during D&D-style class meetings. The format uses a simplified, philosophy-focused adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons to encourage students to talk through, debate, and critically engage with the philosophical issues in the assigned readings — not just summarize or repeat them.\nThe core idea: Turn abstract philosophical texts into immersive, narrative “quests” or “dungeons” where the reading provides the backdrop (e.g., a moral dilemma in a kingdom, a metaphysical riddle from an adversarial entity, or an epistemological challenge). This creates lively discussion, risk, uncertainty, and stakes via dice rolls — mirroring real philosophical debate.\n\n\nKey Differences from Traditional D&D\nThis is not full tabletop RPG gameplay (no complex combat, character stats, or long campaigns). It is a structured, turn-based discussion tool designed to make philosophy feel urgent, personal, and collaborative. Overall Assignment Setup\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReading Schedule\nAdjust all dates by one for Tuesday Thursday Course\nWeeklies Due Every Monday Starting Jan 19\nWed Jan 14, handouts\nMon Jan 19 MLK Day, no classes\nWed Jan 21, Chapter 2, Simulation Hypothesis\nMon Jan 26, Chapter 3, Knowledge\nWed Jan 28, The external world, ch. 4\nMon Feb 2, ch. 5, Possible realities, bostrom and Moravec\nWed Feb 4, ch. 6, What is Reality?\nMon Fed 9, ch. 7, Is God a hacker in the universe up?\nWed Fed 11, ch. 8 Information, 2nd DND Adventure, Student Led\nMon Feb 16, ch. 9, On Bits\nWed Feb 18, ch. 10, Reality and Virtual Reality\nMon Feb 23, ch. 11, Illusion Machines\nWed Feb 25, Quiz 1\nMon Mar 02, Spring Break\nWed Mar 4, Spring Break\nMon Mar 9, ch. 13 ch. 12, 3rd DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 11, ch. 14, Mind and body Realism inside a virtual universe\nMon Mar 16, ch. 15, 4th DND Adventure, Student Led\nWed Mar 18, ch. 16, The extended mind hypothsis\nMon Mar 23, ch. 17 Critical Reflection Due\nWed Mar 25, ch. 18, Virtual ethics and intentiality\nMon Mar 30, ch. 19, Social Ontology inside virtual worlds\nWed Apr 1, ch. 20, 5th DND Adventure on Sense and Reference, Student Led\nMon Apr 6, ch. 21, Cause and effect inside virtual systems\nWed Apr 8, ch. 22, Mathematical, physical and cultural structualism\nMon Apr 13, ch. 23, Virtual Eden?\nWed Apr 15, ch. 24, Brains in a Vat\nMon Apr 20, TBD\nWed Apr 22, TBD\nMon Apr 27, TBD\nWed Apr 29, last day of classes, Final Quiz\nPaper Due on Day of Final Quiz (Submit on Canvas)",

    "section": "Proofs for the Existence of God",
    "text": "Proofs for the Existence of God\n\n\nOntological Argument\n\nThis is the a priori argument : prior to considering the existence of the physical universe. This is reasoning without bringing in any consideration of the existence of the universe or any part of it. This is an argument considering the idea of god alone.\nThe argument is considered to be one of the most intriguing ever devised. It took over 400 years for Philosophers to realize what its actual flaws were. As an “a priori” argument, the Ontological Argument tries to “prove” the existence of God by establishing the necessity of God’s existence through an explanation of the concept of existence or necessary being .\n\n\nVIEW: Ontological Argument\nVIEW: Ontological Argument and Anselm: Crash Course Philosophy #9\n\n\nAnselm, Archbishop of Canterbury first set forth the Ontological Argument in the eleventh century. This argument is the primary locus for such philosophical problems as whether existence is a property and whether or not the notion of necessary existence is intelligible. It is also the only one of the traditional arguments that clearly leads to the necessary properties of God, such as Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc. Anselm’s argument may be conceived as a “reductiio ad absurdum” argument. In such an argument, one begins with a supposition, which is the contrary to what one is attempting to prove. Coupling the supposition with various existing certain or self-evident assumption will yield a contradiction in the end. This contradiction is what is used to demonstrate that the contrary of the original supposition is true.\n\n\n\nTwo Forms:\nForm 1:\nPremises:\n(1.a.) Anselm- the supreme being- that being greater than which none can be conceived (gcb)\n(1.b.) the gcb must be conceived of as existing in reality and not just in the mind or else the gcb is not that being greater than which none can be conceived.\nSuppose (S) that the greatest conceivable being (GCB) exists in the mind alone and not in reality(gcb1).\n\nThen the greatest conceivable being would not be the greatest conceivable being because one could think of a being like (gcb1) but think of the gcb as existing in reality (gcb2) and not just in the mind.\n\nSo, gcb1 would not be the GCB but gcb2 would be.\nConclusion:\nThus to think of the GCB is to think of the gcb2, i.e. a being that exists in reality and not just in the mind.\n\n\n\nForm 2: God as Necessary Being\nPremises:\n\nGod is either a necessary being or a contingent being.\n\nThere is nothing contradictory about god being a necessary being\n\nSo, it is possible that god exists as a necessary being.\n\nSo if it is possible that God is a necessary being then God exists.\n\nBecause God is not a contingent being.\n\n\nConclusion:\nGod must exist as a necessary being.\n\n\nNotes on the Ontological arguments of Anselm and Descartes\nAnselm begins by defining the most central term in his argument - God. Without asserting that God exists, Anselm asks what is it that we mean when we refer to the idea of “God.” When we speak of a God, Anselm implies, we are speaking of the most supreme being. That is, let “god” = “something than which nothing greater can be thought.” Anselm’s definition of God might sound confusing upon first hearing it, but he is simply restating our intuitive understanding of what is meant by the concept “God.” Thus, for the purpose of this argument let “God” = “a being than which nothing greater can be conceived.”\nWithin your understanding, then, you possess the concept of God. As a non-believer, you might argue that you have a concept of unicorn (after all, it is the shared concept that allows us to discuss such a thing) but the concept is simply an idea of a thing. After all, we understand what a unicorn is but we do not believe that they exist. Anselm would agree.\n\n\nTwo key points have been made thus far:\n\nWhen we speak of God (whether we are asserting God is or God is not), we are contemplating an entity whom can be defined as “a being which nothing greater can be conceived.”;\nWhen we speak of God (either as believer or non-believer), we have an intra-mental understanding of that concept, i.e. the idea is within our understanding.\n\n\nAnselm continues by examining the difference between that which exists in the mind and that which exists both in the mind and outside of the mind as well. What is being asked here is: Is it greater to exist in the mind alone or in the mind and in reality (or outside of the mind)? Anselm asks you to consider the painter, e.g. define which is greater: the reality of a painting as it exists in the mind of an artist, or that same painting existing in the mind of that same artist and as a physical piece of art. Anselm contends that the painting, existing both within the mind of the artist and as a real piece of art, is greater than the mere intra-mental conception of the work. Let me offer a real-world example: If someone were to offer you a dollar, but you had to choose between the dollar that exists within their mind or the dollar that exists both in their mind and in reality, which dollar would you choose? Are you sure…\n\n\nAt this point, we have a third key point established:\n\nIt is greater to exist in the mind and in reality, then to exist in the mind alone.\n\nHave you figured out where Anselm is going with this argument?\n\nIf God is that than greater which cannot be conceived (established in #1 above);\nAnd since it is greater to exist in the mind and in reality than in the mind alone (established in #3 above);\nThen God must exist both in the mind (established in #2 above) and in reality;\nIn short, God must be. God is not merely an intra-mental concept but an extra-mental reality as well.\n\n\nBut why? Because if God is truly that than greater which cannot be conceived, it follows that God must exist both in the mind and in reality. If God did not exist in reality as well as our understanding, then we could conceive of a greater being i.e. a being that does exist extramentally and intramentally. But, by definition, there can be no greater being. Thus, there must be a corresponding extra-mental reality to our intra-mental conception of God. God’s existence outside of our understanding is logically necessary.\nSometimes, Anselm’s argument is presented as a Reductio Ad Absurdum (RAA). In an RAA, you reduce to absurdity the antithesis of your view. Since the antithesis is absurd, your view must be correct. Anselm’s argument would look something like this:\n\n\n\nEither [God exists] or [God does not exist].\nAssume [God does not exist] (the antithesis of Anselm’s position)\nIf [God does not exist] (but exists only as an intra-mental concept), then that being which nothing greater which can be conceived, is a being which a greater being can be conceived. This is a logical impossibility (remember criterion #3);\nTherefore, [God does not exist] is incorrect;\n\nConclusion:\n\nTherefore [God exists].\n\n\n\n\nClarifications:\n\nThe argument is not that “If you believe that god exists then god exists”.\nThat would be too ridiculous to ask anyone to accept that if you believe that X exists and is real then X exists and is real.\nThe ontological argument does not ask a person to assume that there is a deity or even a GCB.\n\n\nIt asks anyone at all to simply THINK of the deity as the GREATEST CONCEIVABLE BEING and then it indicates that a being that exists in reality (outside of the mind) is greater than one that is just in the mind (imagination). So, the conclusion is that if you think of the GCB you must THINK that the GCB exists not just in your thinking (mind) but in reality (outside of your mind) as well.\nIt is greater to think of a being existing outside of the mind as well as in the mind so if you think of the GCB you must THINK THAT the GCB exists not just inside of the mind (imagination) but outside of the mind as well (in reality).\nLook at it this way: Anselm invites people to think about a certain conception of the deity,i.e., that of the GCB. What Anselm did was to place into the concept itself the idea that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. So you THINK of the GCB and what are you doing when you do that? You must think that the GCB exists outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. Why must you think that? Because it you did not think that, then you would not be thinking of the GCB as defined by Anselm.\nIt is like this: Think of a triangle. If you do you must think of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees. Why? Because if you are not thinking of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees then you are not thinking of a triangle. So IF you are to THINK of a triangle you must THINK of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees.\nIf you are to THINK of a GCB you must THINK that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. Why? Because if you are not thinking that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination then you are not thinking of the GCB.\nIn all of this it is only thinking. Anselm proved what must be thought about the GCB given how the GCB was defined and not whether the GCB actually exists.\n\n\nA variation of this argument by Alvin Plantinga exists. It is known as the Modal Version of the Ontological Argument:\n\n\nTo say that there is possibly a God is to say that there is a possible world in which God exists.\nTo say that God necessarily exists is to say that God exists in every possible world.\nGod is necessarily perfect (i.e. maximally excellent)\nSince God is necessarily perfect, he is perfect in every possible world.\nIf God is perfect in every possible world, he must exist in every possible world, therefore God exists.\nGod is also maximally great. To be maximally great is to be perfect in every possible world.\nTherefore: “it is possible that there is a God,” means that there is a possible which contains God, that God is maximally great, and the God exists in every possible world and is consequently necessary.\nGod’s existence is at least possible.\nTherefore: as per item seven, God exists.\n\n\n\nRene Descartes, 1596 - 1650, is also credited with formulating a version of the ontological argument. One possible presentation of the Cartesian argument is as follows:\n\nIf there is a God it is a perfect being;\nA perfect being possesses all possible perfections;\nExistence is a perfection;\nTherefore, God necessarily possesses the quality of existence. Simply, God exists.\n\n\nThe actual texts:\nAnselm’s Philosophy\nAnselm’s Argument\nMonologium\nProslogium\nGuanilo’s Response and Anselm’s response to Guanilo\n\nPROBLEMS:\nThe problem with the ontological argument is NOT\n\nthat some people refuse to think of the GCB or\nthat some people have a resistance to a belief in a deity\nthat some people just refuse to accept the deity\n\nNO NO NO the problem with the Argument is that it has FLAWS. It has a LOGICAL MISTAKE in it.\nWhat is that error in the argument???",

We can not understand, in any meaningful way, what exactly is meant by such words. The reality behind the term is completely transcedent to the human knower;\nSecond: Even if we grant that the concept of God as “that than greater which can not be conceived” exists in the understanding, there is no reason to believe that the concept necessitates the extra-mental reality of God.

    "text": "II. Existence is not a predicate\nImmanuel Kant (1724 - 1804), offered what many believe to be a damning critique of Anselm’s ontological argument.\n\nLet us return to our discussion of unicorns and God.\nAnselm has argued that there exists a difference between the concept of “unicorn” as it exists intra-mentally and extra-mentally.\nIf we claim that the “unicorn” is, we are somehow adding to the concept. We are endowing the concept with an additional predicate, i.e. the quality that it is.\n\nThe point of Anselm’s argument is that the predicate of existence can be demonstrated for the concept of “God.”\n\nKant does not agree with Anselm’s treatment of existence as a predicate. The concept of “unicorn” is not changed in any way if we claim that it is. Nor is the concept damaged if we claim that unicorns are not. According to Kant,“…we do not make the least addition to the thing when we further declare that this thing is.” If existence is not a predicate, then Anselm’s argument has not demonstrated any meaningful information.\nKant thought that, while the concept of a supreme being was useful, it was only an idea, which in and of itself could not help us in our determining the correctness of the concept. While it was a possibility, he felt that the “a priori” stance of the argument it would be necessary to buttress it with experience.\nFor Kant what Anselm did was to prove that humans MUST THINK THAT a deity exists in reality and not just in the mind as an idea as the GCB but that does not mean that the GCB actually does exist in reality. The idea of the GCB exists and the idea of the GCB as an actual being does exist but the reality or actuality of the GCB is not established based on the thoughts alone.",

    "text": "III. The Greatest Conceivable EVIL Being.\n\nAs an “a priori” argument, the Ontological Argument tries to “prove” the existence of God by establishing the necessity of God’s existence through an explanation of the concept of existence or necessary being. As this criticism of the Ontological Argument shows, the same arguments used to prove an all-powerful god, could be used to prove an all-powerful devil. Since there could not exist two all-powerful beings (one’s power must be subordinate to the other), this is an example of one of the weaknesses in this type of theorizing. Furthermore, the concept of necessary existence, by using Anselm’s second argument, allows us to “define” other things into existence.\nThe argument could prove the existence of that being more EVIL than which no other can be conceived just as easily as it supposedly proves the existence of the being that is the greatest conceivable being.\nThink of a being that is the most evil being that can be conceived. That being must be conceived of as existing in reality and not just in the mind or it wouldn’t be the most evil being which can be conceived for a being that does not exist in reality is not evil at all.",

    "section": "IV. Empiricist Critique",
    "text": "IV. Empiricist Critique\nAquinas, 1225 - 1274, once declared the official philosopher of the Catholic Church, built his objection to the ontological argument on epistemological grounds.\n\nEpistemology is the study of knowledge. It is a branch of philosophy that seeks to answer such questions as: What is knowledge?; What is truth?; How does knowing occur?; et cetera. Aquinas is known as an empiricist. Empiricists claim that knowledge comes from sense experience. Aquinas wrote: “Nothing is in the intellect which was not first in the senses.”\nWithin Thomas’ empiricism, we can not reason or infer the existence of God from a studying of the definition of God. We can know God only indirectly, through our experiencing of God as Cause to that which we experience in the natural world. We can not assail the heavens with our reason; we can only know God as the Necessary Cause of all that we observe.\nAlvin Plantiga offers a counter argument to the counter arguments that at least establishes the rational acceptability of theism as it appears to support the idea that it is possible that the greatest conceivable being does exist.\n\n\n\nOther Philosophers and their Critiques:\n\nRené Descartes, from The Philosophy of Descartes in Extracts from His Writings.

P. 278 et seq.\n\n\nView also Debunking the Teleological, Cosmological, and Ontological Arguments for the Existence of God\nRead the critiques of the Ontological Argument\n\n\n\nConcluding Summary:\n\nWhat it does prove:\n\n\nAnselm proves that if you think of the GCB you must THINK that it exists.\nDescartes proves that if you conceive of an ALL PERFECT being you must CONCEIVE (THINK) of that being as existing.\n\n\nKant points out that even though you must THINK that it exists does not mean that it does exist. Existence is not something we can know from the mere idea itself. It is not known as a predicate of a subject. Independent confirmation through experience is needed.\nThe argument does give some support to those who are already believers. It has variations that establish the possibility of the existence of such a being.\nThe argument will not convert the non-believer into a believer.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome Assessment\nThis argument or proof does not establish the actual existence of a supernatural deity. It attempts to define a being into existence and that is not rationally legitimate. While the argument can not be used to convert a non-believer to a believer, the faults in the argument do not prove that there is no god. The Burden of Proof demands that the positive claim that there is a supernatural deity be established by reason and evidence and this argument does not meet that standard. The believer in god can use the argument to establish the mere logical possibility that there is a supernatural deity or at least that it is not irrational to believe in the possibility that there is such a being. The argument does not establish any degree of probability at all.\n\nOUTCOME:\nThe Argument:\nPremises\n\nSuppose (S) that the greatest conceivable being (GCB) exists in the mind alone and not in reality(gcb1).\nThen the greatest conceivable being would not be the greatest conceivable being because one could think of a being like (gcb1) but think of the gcb as existing in reality (gcb2) and not just in the mind.\nSo, gcb1 would not be the GCB but gcb2 would be.\nThus to think of the GCB is to think of the gcb2, i.e. a being that exists in reality and not just in the mind.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The GCB ( Deity) exists\nProblem with argument:\n\n____Premises are false\n____Premises are irrelevant\n____Premises Contain the Conclusion –Circular Reasoning\n__X__Premises are inadequate to support the conclusion\n____Alternative arguments exist with equal or greater support\n\n\n\nThis argument or proof has flaws in it and would not convince a rational person to accept its conclusion.\nThis is not because someone who does not believe in a deity will simply refuse to accept based on emotions or past history but because it is not rationally compelling of acceptance of its conclusion.\n\n\nIt would be a mistake in thinking, a violation of logic and a fallacy to think that because this argument or attempt to prove that there is a deity of some type does not work or has flaws that the opposite conclusion must be true, namely that there is no deity of any type. The error is known as the fallacy “argumentum ad ignoratio” or the appeal to ignorance. It is the mistake in thinking that if an argument cannot prove a proposition or claim P is true then P must be false. OR if you cannot prove that P is false then P must be true. It is a mistake to think that way., a logical error.\nProceed to the next section.\nCreative Commons License Introduction to Philosophy by Philip A.

    "text": "Weekly Reflections (32 points): These will be done each week in class. Each reflection is worth a possible total of 8 points. There are 12 possible reflections. I will only grade 8 or your best reflections for a possible total of 32 points.\nEach week on Wednesday (except Aug. 19th, August 26th, Oct 14th, Nov 25th, Dec 2nd, Dec 9th) a short weekly will be due, (just the front and back of a 3x5 note card). Weeklies will be based on the assigned readings and/or the discussion from the previous class. Each weekly is worth 7 points (maximum), and I will assign a total of 11 weeklies. I will drop the three lowest scored weeklies. Since I include in your total paper grade 11 weeklies at 10 points per weekly, the total points possible on weeklies is 110. If you should earn more than one hundred points on weeklies, all additional points count as extra credit. Finally, since the weekly is due at the beginning of class, arriving to class on time is essential. I will not accept the weekly after 5 minutes from the start of class. If you arrive late or are absent, you receive a zero for the weekly. I do give partial credit for weeklies, and just putting your name on the top is worth one point. (It would be best if you purchase a set of 3x5 note cards to right your weekly on.) The purpose of these weeklies is to help me assess how e↵ectively I am going over the material. As such, what I am looking for is a short/ concise exposition of either the reading or of the discussion from the week before. I will let you know which when I assign the weekly on the Monday prior.\nQuizzes 1 & 2 (80 points): Each Quiz is worth a possible total of 10 points per category, times 4 categories equals 40 points times 2 Quizzes.\nEach of the scheduled examinations will cover lectures, discussions and assigned readings from the classes that precede it. You are responsible for assigned readings without regard to whether they were covered in class. The final examination will focus primarily on the lectures, discussions and readings subsequent to the first examination, but it may cover material from the whole semester. I generally do not give makeup examinations. I believe that doing so penalizes those who diligently prepare for class.\nCritical Reflection 1 & 2 (160 points): Each reflective analysis is worth a possible total of 20 points per category, times 4 categories equals 80 points times 2 reflection pieces.\nYou will be required to write one paper, which must be type-written, double-spaced, and six to eight pages in length. This is NOT a research paper. Below are several topics, each student must choose ONE to which s/he will respond. If you wish to write a paper on a topic other than one of those suggested by me contact me after class and we can make an appointment during my office hours to discuss other topics. (I will be more than happy to approve relevant topics.) The papers you write are not opinion papers. It is standard practice among philosophers to view mere opinion to be worth less than the energy used to express it. What is worthwhile is a reasoned defense of one’s opinion. Your paper should be written so as to present rational argument for the position which you hold.\nYour paper should consist of two distinct parts. The first part, which should account for approximately half the length of the paper, should be a short explication of the essay you have chosen. This part should contain a statement of the author’s position, a statement of your own position (tell me whether you agree or disagree with the author) and an explanation of the author’s supporting arguments. The second half of the paper should consist of your own evaluation or critique of the essay. In this part of the paper you should tell me WHY you agree or disagree with the author. If you agree with the author you should tell me what argument(s) are convincing. Then tell me what argument(s) might be pro↵ered by one who disagrees with the author and how the author might respond. If you disagree with the author, you should provide criticism of the author’s essay and attempt to explain how the author might respond to the criticism. Hence, whether you agree or disagree with the author, you should provide arguments against the author and responses thereto. Finally, you should explain why you believe your position is the best position. You must NOT use outside sources for this essay. I will provide a more detailed account in class.\n\nD&D Campaigns (96 points total)\n\nOverview & Purpose\nYour grade in this area is based on preparation and active participation during D&D-style class meetings. The format uses a simplified, philosophy-focused adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons to encourage students to talk through, debate, and critically engage with the philosophical issues in the assigned readings — not just summarize or repeat them.\nThe core idea: Turn abstract philosophical texts into immersive, narrative “quests” or “dungeons” where the reading provides the backdrop (e.g., a moral dilemma in a kingdom, a metaphysical riddle from an adversarial entity, or an epistemological challenge). This creates lively discussion, risk, uncertainty, and stakes via dice rolls — mirroring real philosophical debate.\n\n\nKey Differences from Traditional D&D\nThis is not full tabletop RPG gameplay (no complex combat, character stats, or long campaigns). It is a structured, turn-based discussion tool designed to make philosophy feel urgent, personal, and collaborative. Overall Assignment Setup",

    "section": "Lecture Notes – Oliver Wendell Holmes and Jerome Frank, Legal Realism",
    "text": "Lecture Notes – Oliver Wendell Holmes and Jerome Frank, Legal Realism\n• American Legal Realism is a critical position in legal theory inspired by the work of John Chapman Gray and Oliver Wendell Holmes.\no A bit of background on Holmes: he was a legal scholar and US Supreme Court Justice. He was also a founding member, with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce and Chauncy Wright, of the Metaphysical Club, which was a group that met at Harvard in 1872. It was in this club that the position that developed into American Pragmatism was first developed. (Also the subject of a wonderful book by Louis Menand.)\n▪ These early pragmatists were metaphysical quietists. ▪ Committed to the idea that if something doesn’t make a difference in practice, then it’s not worth talking about. Differences/distinctions that don’t make a difference in practice are no differences/distinctions at all.\n▪ Peirce’s pragmatic maxim: • “Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.” (EP1: 132)\n▪ James called his pragmatism “radical empiricism” • ‘the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience’ ▪ We can see these ideas imprinted on Holmes’s thought about “the law.” • “The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.” • The law is nothing more than its practical effects, and those are affected on others by the courts. • Holmes argues for this position on an empirical basis rather than on conceptual grounds, as Hart, Austin, and the Natural Lawyers defended their positions.\n• He sought to understand both how law shows up in the experience of those who it affects and how judges actually arrived at their decisions.\no How do those who are governed actually experience the law?\n▪ They experience it as an imposition of public force:\n• “You can see very plainly that a bad man has as much reason as a good one for wishing to avoid an encounter with the public force, and therefore you can see the practical importance of the distinction between morality and law. A man who cares nothing for an ethical rule which is believed and practised by his neighbors is likely nevertheless to care a good deal to avoid being made to pay money, and will want to keep out of jail if he can.”\n• Holmes, then, maintains the separability thesis, but he does so on empirical grounds\no He is not a cynic, however…his purpose is to contend that if one wants to study and practice the law, one must look at it from a business-like perspective, and this means seeing it as distinct from law.\n• Though law is, he says, “the witness and external deposit of our moral lives.”\n▪ So, then, we can make our inquiry more precise by asking how the bad man experiences the law.\n• He wants to know what he can get away with, what he can do without incurring the imposition of public force. • “But what does it mean to a bad man? Mainly, and in the first place, a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment of money.”\n• The bad man is concerned with law as a prediction of likely consequences, and since those consequences are determined by the court, he is concerned with law merely as a prediction of how the courts will decide.\no Holmes examples: contract\n• How would Hart respond to this understanding of law as a prediction of what the courts will decide???\n▪ In the making of such predictions (and in the deciding of cases) we do well to not confuse the moral use of terms and their legal use:\n• Example of Malice\no In morality, malice requires ill intent\no In law, it need not, though it may.\n▪ “I think that the law regards the infliction of temporal damage by a responsible person as actionable, if under the circumstances known to him the danger of his act is manifest according to common experience, or according to his own experience if it is more than common, except in cases where upon special grounds of policy the law refuses to protect the plaintiff or grants a privilege to the defendant. I think that commonly malice, intent, and negligence mean only that the danger was manifest to a greater or less degree, under the circumstances known to the actor, although in some cases of privilege malice may mean an actual malevolent motive, and such a motive may take away a permission knowingly to inflict harm, which otherwise would be granted on this or that ground of dominant public good.” • Example of Contracts: o In morals, contracts or promises are dependent on the internal state of the persons’ minds.\no In law, contracts are purely formal. Whatever the court determines one to be contractually obligated to on the basis of the executed contract is what one is obligated to no matter the internal state of one’s mind.\no How do (and should) judges decide cases?\n▪ We tend to think that judges apply the law, but legal realists think that judges are mostly in the business of making law.\n▪ Why?\n• the class of available legal materials is insufficient to logically entail a unique legal outcome in most cases worth litigating at the appellate level (the Local Indeterminacy Thesis);\n• in such cases, judges make new law in deciding legal disputes through the exercise of a lawmaking discretion (the Discretion Thesis); and\n• judicial decisions in indeterminate cases are influenced by the judge’s political and moral convictions, not by legal considerations.\n▪ Examine this passage (p 466)\n• Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You always can imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some opinion as to policy, or, in short, because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battle grounds where the means do not exist for determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place. We do not realize how large a part of our law is open to reconsideration upon a slight change in the habit of the public mind.\n▪ Judges, Holmes thinks, ought to be more explicit about these hidden drivers of their decisions, and ought to be clear that they make decisions with social advantage in mind.\n▪ This would allow for a re-examination of history and tradition in the law.\n• Turn to p. 470.\n• Example of whether we can know that the criminal law does more good than harm in present circumstances.",

    "section": "D&D Campaign Rules",
    "text": "D&D Campaign Rules\n\nGroup Structure: By Week 2, students form small groups of 5 members each (via random assignment).\nRotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role: Each group member serves as DM once during the semester (one full session/day).\n\nThis distributes prep work fairly.\nThe DM “owns” that day’s reading/topic and facilitates the session. A ready-made D&D-style adventure outline (framing the text’s core issues narratively) will be provided to the DM.\nThe DM may use the provided example scenario or adapt it to create a unique situation that forces questioning of taken-for-granted beliefs.\nThe DM begins by rolling a d20 to help determine positions or difficulty.\n\nSession Play Through\n\nDM Preparation & Introduction\nThe DM presents a brief summary of the assigned text. They then narrate the adventure setup: The group is a party of adventurers facing sequential challenges drawn directly from the reading’s key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments.\n\n\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created a conscious simulated population → debate obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with someone in an MMO known only as their character → is this true love?\nSimulation argument scenario (e.g., billions of non-sims imply billions of sims; successful simUniverse program implies many more sims than non-sims → motivate and debate each premise narratively).\n\n\n\nClass-Wide Polling (for Key Reasons/Premises)\nFor multi-premise topics (e.g., simulation argument’s three reasons), the full class takes quick polls: For each reason, more people agree or disagree? This identifies the “intuitive” (majority) vs. “least likely” (minority) position.\n\n\nTurn-Based Challenges & Dice Rolls\n\nThe DM reads/presents each challenge/encounter in sequence.\nGroup members respond in turns (going around the table):\nAsk a clarifying question (probe the text/concept).\nOffer a suggestion/solution (propose a philosophical position, argument, counter, edge case, or objection from the reading).\n\n\n\nDice Mechanic (simple d20, no modifiers):\n\nDM sets/rolls a difficulty (e.g., rolls 10).\nResponding student rolls d20.\nHigher than DM roll (“win”): Defend/attack the intuitive position (majority poll view).\nLower than DM roll (“lose”): Defend the least likely position (minority poll view).\n\n\n\nThe student states their position/argument.\n\nSubsequent group members build on, counter, or add considerations to prior responses — creating back-and-forth dialogue.\nDice add chance, excitement, and stakes (you might have to argue against your own intuition).\n\n\n\nResolution & Debrief\n\nDM adjudicates collective outcomes: What positions seem plausible? Which arguments prevailed?\nSession ends with group/class reflection:\nHow did the “adventure” illuminate the reading?\nWhat arguments won/lost?\nHow does this apply to real philosophy?\nDid anyone’s view change?\n\n\n\nTracking & Submission (Tally Sheet)\nEveryone maintains their own tally sheet/adventure sheet (linked in course materials). You will use this sheet to record the key positions taken for each reason/premise/challenge (defend or object/critique). By session end, the sheet should show one position per group member per major point. You will then upload a photo/scan of your completed tally sheet to Canvas after each session (under the assignment module). Please keep the physical/digital sheet for the entire semester — it tracks your cumulative participation.\n\n\n\nGrading Notes\n96 points total for the component.\n\nAssessed via preparation (e.g., coming ready to engage) and quality/quantity of contributions during sessions (tracked partly via tally sheets).\nFocus: Genuine critical reflection, referencing peers’ ideas, challenging assumptions, and engaging the text — not “winning” arguments or perfect rolls.\n\nThis format transforms passive reading into active, communal philosophical practice. Questions? Ask in class, office hours, or via email — let’s make these sessions philosophically epic.",
