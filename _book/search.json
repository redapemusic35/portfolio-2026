This will be done using a randomizing method.\nRotating Dungeon Master (DM) Role: Every group member gets one turn to act as the Dungeon Master (DM) for a full session/day.\n\nThis distributes the workload fairly—no one is stuck doing all the prep.\nThe DM takes ownership of that day’s reading/topic transforming it into a D&D-style adventure. The DM will be given the adventure, they then give the problems to the other students in a turn-based format.",

    "text": "Session Format (When a Student is DM)\n\n1. Presentation of the Reading\nThe DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOtehr group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?",
