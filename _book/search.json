    "text": "Session Format (When a Student is DM)\n\n1. Presentation of the Reading\nThe DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOtehr group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?",

While I still believe that the heavy emphasis on formal logic is important, it was not intuitive, and logic done well is intuitive. I eventually discovered Peter (smit21b?)’s Logic Matters. I recommended it to students as a supplementary reading and was pleased with the feedback and the improvement in their understanding.

The student, course instructor and Academic Success will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Academic Integrity - DO NOT CHEAT. As a member of Stetson University, I agree to uphold the highest standards of integrity in my academic work. I promise that I will neither give nor receive unauthorized aid of any kind on my tests, papers, and assignments. When using the ideas, thoughts, or words of another in my work, I will always provide clear acknowledgement of the individuals and sources on which I am relying. I will avoid using fraudulent, falsified, or fabricated evidence and/or material. I will refrain from resubmitting without authorization work for one class that was obtained from work previously submitted for academic credit in another class. I will not destroy, steal, or make inaccessible any academic resource material. By my actions and my example, I will strive to promote the ideals of honesty, responsibility, trust, fairness, and respect that are at the heart of Stetson’s Honor System. Cheating violates university regulations and is a reportable offense that may result in academic suspension or dismissal from Stetson University. Every violation of the Honor System will be promptly reported to the Honor System Council for further investigation. In addition to these academic integrity standards, I expect students to treat everyone in the classroom—the instructor, fellow students, and guests—with common courtesy and respect.",

Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy.\nThe honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use. Recordings may NOT be shared with other people without written consent from the professor. The information contained in recordings constitutes intellectual property and is protected under federal copyright laws. This information may NOT be published or quoted without the express written consent of the professor and without giving proper identification and credit to the professor. Recordings of this class may not be used in any way against the faculty member, teaching assistant, other lecturer, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class. Violation of these stipulations will result in being reported to the Office of Community Standards.\nD. Food Insecurity: At Stetson University, we are committed to supporting students’ well-being, including ensuring access to nutritious food. If you are experiencing a lack of access to safe and nutritious food, the Hatters Helping Hatters Food Pantry is her to help. The Food Pantry is a free, no-questions-asked supplemental food resource for all Stetson students, staff & faculty. Food Pantry location:\n\nCarlton Union Building (CUB 278), open 24 hours.",

A D&D-style adventure will be provided for the class and the DM will be given the adventure. They then give the problems to the other students in a turn-based format.

They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOtehr group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?",

    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\nIf syllables in a poem had life and perception for just as long as their sounds lasted, the rhythmicality and beauty of the whole intricately inwoven work could not give them pleasure.\n\n\nBut before we get to the kinds of reflections, we start first with what amounts to the beautiful. This begins with a description of the world as it is, not necessarily how we experience it.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

A D&D-style adventure will be provided for the class and the DM will be given the adventure. They then give the problems to the other students in a turn-based format.

The idea is to encourage students to talk through the philosophical issues we read about.\nIdeally you begin by imagining being in a unique situation that makes you question some belief that you’ve always taken for granted.\nEach day that we do the activity, each group will have a new DM for that day. The DM rolls the dice to set the difficulty class. They then read the encounter.\n\nThere are billions of people (non sims) in the actual universe.\nTherefore there will be billions of sim people in the sim universe.\nSuch a program, the simUniverse, will likely be very successful and there will be many, many simUniverses sold.\n\nTherefore there will be many more sims than non sims.\n\nEncounter\nThe DM then reads an imagined context that motivates each of the reasons above in a turn based format.\nGoing around the table, the DM has each member of their group roll a d20 to determine what position on one of the reasons above, they are going to take. Do they defend the reason given, or do they critique it?\nFirst, as a class we take three polls, one for each reason. Is there more who agree with the reason above, or disagree with it?\nNext,\n\nThe DM rolls a dice and gets 10.\n\nWinning roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls higher, they get to defend the intuitive position.\nThis is whichever position there is most agreement for.\n\nLosing roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls lower than the DM, then they will have to defend the least likely answer.\nThe position with the least agreement for.\n\nThe students gives their position which is recorded onto everyone’s tally sheets. At the end of the campaign for that day, each sheet should have a set of positions for each of the reasons above, either defending it, or objecting to it, one from each member of the group.\nEveryone should have their own copy of the tally sheet. You will upload a photo of it to Canvas under the assignment module. You keep the tally sheet for the entire semester.\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned.

The plausibility of the premises which are taken as given is questionable.\nThere are no premises—the paper merely restates the thesis.

If you feel that you have an extremely strong case for a grade change, you may submit a one-page essay explaining your reasons to me within one week of your work being returned.\nA.Honor Code: University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy.\nThe honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use. Recordings may NOT be shared with other people without written consent from the professor. The information contained in recordings constitutes intellectual property and is protected under federal copyright laws. This information may NOT be published or quoted without the express written consent of the professor and without giving proper identification and credit to the professor. Recordings of this class may not be used in any way against the faculty member, teaching assistant, other lecturer, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class. Violation of these stipulations will result in being reported to the Office of Community Standards.\nD. Food Insecurity: At Stetson University, we are committed to supporting students’ well-being, including ensuring access to nutritious food. If you are experiencing a lack of access to safe and nutritious food, the Hatters Helping Hatters Food Pantry is her to help. The Food Pantry is a free, no-questions-asked supplemental food resource for all Stetson students, staff & faculty. Food Pantry location:\n\nCarlton Union Building (CUB 278), open 24 hours.",

    "text": "Session Format (When a Student is DM)\n\n1. Presentation of the Reading\nThe DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOther group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?\nDid you change your original position?\n\nStudents will be evaluated based on a total of 640 points, with the final grade determined by the percentage of points earned. The components are as follows:\n\nFor more detailed information regarding grades, see the rubric here\n\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the DND Adventures, see the DND addendum here\n\nAttendance (5% of final grade, 32 points):\n\nBased on unexcused absences throughout the semester.\n\nGrading Scale (equal increments of 8 points):\n\n\n\n0–1\nunexcused absences:\n32 points\n\n\n2\nunexcused absences:\n24 points\n\n\n3–4\nunexcused absences:\n16 points\n\n\n5–6\nunexcused absences:\n8 points\n\n\n6\nunexcused absences:\n0 points",

    "section": "Lecture Notes – Oliver Wendell Holmes and Jerome Frank, Legal Realism",
    "text": "Lecture Notes – Oliver Wendell Holmes and Jerome Frank, Legal Realism\n• American Legal Realism is a critical position in legal theory inspired by the work of John Chapman Gray and Oliver Wendell Holmes.\no A bit of background on Holmes: he was a legal scholar and US Supreme Court Justice. He was also a founding member, with William James, Charles Sanders Peirce and Chauncy Wright, of the Metaphysical Club, which was a group that met at Harvard in 1872. It was in this club that the position that developed into American Pragmatism was first developed. (Also the subject of a wonderful book by Louis Menand.)\n▪ These early pragmatists were metaphysical quietists. ▪ Committed to the idea that if something doesn’t make a difference in practice, then it’s not worth talking about. Differences/distinctions that don’t make a difference in practice are no differences/distinctions at all.\n▪ Peirce’s pragmatic maxim: • “Consider what effects, which might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of those effects is the whole of our conception of the object.” (EP1: 132)\n▪ James called his pragmatism “radical empiricism” • ‘the only things that shall be debatable among philosophers shall be things definable in terms drawn from experience’ ▪ We can see these ideas imprinted on Holmes’s thought about “the law.” • “The prophecies of what the courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law.” • The law is nothing more than its practical effects, and those are affected on others by the courts. • Holmes argues for this position on an empirical basis rather than on conceptual grounds, as Hart, Austin, and the Natural Lawyers defended their positions.\n• He sought to understand both how law shows up in the experience of those who it affects and how judges actually arrived at their decisions.\no How do those who are governed actually experience the law?\n▪ They experience it as an imposition of public force:\n• “You can see very plainly that a bad man has as much reason as a good one for wishing to avoid an encounter with the public force, and therefore you can see the practical importance of the distinction between morality and law. A man who cares nothing for an ethical rule which is believed and practised by his neighbors is likely nevertheless to care a good deal to avoid being made to pay money, and will want to keep out of jail if he can.”\n• Holmes, then, maintains the separability thesis, but he does so on empirical grounds\no He is not a cynic, however…his purpose is to contend that if one wants to study and practice the law, one must look at it from a business-like perspective, and this means seeing it as distinct from law.\n• Though law is, he says, “the witness and external deposit of our moral lives.”\n▪ So, then, we can make our inquiry more precise by asking how the bad man experiences the law.\n• He wants to know what he can get away with, what he can do without incurring the imposition of public force. • “But what does it mean to a bad man? Mainly, and in the first place, a prophecy that if he does certain things he will be subjected to disagreeable consequences by way of imprisonment or compulsory payment of money.”\n• The bad man is concerned with law as a prediction of likely consequences, and since those consequences are determined by the court, he is concerned with law merely as a prediction of how the courts will decide.\no Holmes examples: contract\n• How would Hart respond to this understanding of law as a prediction of what the courts will decide???\n▪ In the making of such predictions (and in the deciding of cases) we do well to not confuse the moral use of terms and their legal use:\n• Example of Malice\no In morality, malice requires ill intent\no In law, it need not, though it may.\n▪ “I think that the law regards the infliction of temporal damage by a responsible person as actionable, if under the circumstances known to him the danger of his act is manifest according to common experience, or according to his own experience if it is more than common, except in cases where upon special grounds of policy the law refuses to protect the plaintiff or grants a privilege to the defendant. I think that commonly malice, intent, and negligence mean only that the danger was manifest to a greater or less degree, under the circumstances known to the actor, although in some cases of privilege malice may mean an actual malevolent motive, and such a motive may take away a permission knowingly to inflict harm, which otherwise would be granted on this or that ground of dominant public good.” • Example of Contracts: o In morals, contracts or promises are dependent on the internal state of the persons’ minds.\no In law, contracts are purely formal. Whatever the court determines one to be contractually obligated to on the basis of the executed contract is what one is obligated to no matter the internal state of one’s mind.\no How do (and should) judges decide cases?\n▪ We tend to think that judges apply the law, but legal realists think that judges are mostly in the business of making law.\n▪ Why?\n• the class of available legal materials is insufficient to logically entail a unique legal outcome in most cases worth litigating at the appellate level (the Local Indeterminacy Thesis);\n• in such cases, judges make new law in deciding legal disputes through the exercise of a lawmaking discretion (the Discretion Thesis); and\n• judicial decisions in indeterminate cases are influenced by the judge’s political and moral convictions, not by legal considerations.\n▪ Examine this passage (p 466)\n• Behind the logical form lies a judgment as to the relative worth and importance of competing legislative grounds, often an inarticulate and unconscious judgment, it is true, and yet the very root and nerve of the whole proceeding. You can give any conclusion a logical form. You always can imply a condition in a contract. But why do you imply it? It is because of some belief as to the practice of the community or of a class, or because of some opinion as to policy, or, in short, because of some attitude of yours upon a matter not capable of exact quantitative measurement, and therefore not capable of founding exact logical conclusions. Such matters really are battle grounds where the means do not exist for determinations that shall be good for all time, and where the decision can do no more than embody the preference of a given body in a given time and place. We do not realize how large a part of our law is open to reconsideration upon a slight change in the habit of the public mind.\n▪ Judges, Holmes thinks, ought to be more explicit about these hidden drivers of their decisions, and ought to be clear that they make decisions with social advantage in mind.\n▪ This would allow for a re-examination of history and tradition in the law.\n• Turn to p. 470.\n• Example of whether we can know that the criminal law does more good than harm in present circumstances.",

The idea is to encourage students to talk through the philosophical issues we read about.\nIdeally you begin by imagining being in a unique situation that makes you question some belief that you’ve always taken for granted.\nEach day that we do the activity, each group will have a new DM for that day. The DM rolls the dice to set the difficulty class. They then read the encounter.\n\nThere are billions of people (non sims) in the actual universe.\nTherefore there will be billions of sim people in the sim universe.\nSuch a program, the simUniverse, will likely be very successful and there will be many, many simUniverses sold.\n\nTherefore there will be many more sims than non sims.\n\nEncounter\nThe DM then reads an imagined context that motivates each of the reasons above in a turn based format.\nGoing around the table, the DM has each member of their group roll a d20 to determine what position on one of the reasons above, they are going to take. Do they defend the reason given, or do they critique it?\nFirst, as a class we take three polls, one for each reason. Is there more who agree with the reason above, or disagree with it?\nNext,\n\nThe DM rolls a dice and gets 10.\n\nWinning roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls higher, they get to defend the intuitive position.\nThis is whichever position there is most agreement for.\n\nLosing roll:\n\nIf the other student rolls lower than the DM, then they will have to defend the least likely answer.\nThe position with the least agreement for.\n\nThe students gives their position which is recorded onto everyone’s tally sheets. At the end of the campaign for that day, each sheet should have a set of positions for each of the reasons above, either defending it, or objecting to it, one from each member of the group.\nEveryone should have their own copy of the tally sheet. You will upload a photo of it to Canvas under the assignment module. You keep the tally sheet for the entire semester.",

As an “a priori” argument, the Ontological Argument tries to “prove” the existence of God by establishing the necessity of God’s existence through an explanation of the concept of existence or necessary being .\n\n\nVIEW: Ontological Argument\nVIEW: Ontological Argument and Anselm: Crash Course Philosophy #9\n\n\nAnselm, Archbishop of Canterbury first set forth the Ontological Argument in the eleventh century. This argument is the primary locus for such philosophical problems as whether existence is a property and whether or not the notion of necessary existence is intelligible. It is also the only one of the traditional arguments that clearly leads to the necessary properties of God, such as Omnipotence, Omniscience, etc. Anselm’s argument may be conceived as a “reductiio ad absurdum” argument. In such an argument, one begins with a supposition, which is the contrary to what one is attempting to prove. Coupling the supposition with various existing certain or self-evident assumption will yield a contradiction in the end. This contradiction is what is used to demonstrate that the contrary of the original supposition is true.\n\n\n\nTwo Forms:\nForm 1:\nPremises:\n(1.a.) Anselm- the supreme being- that being greater than which none can be conceived (gcb)\n(1.b.) the gcb must be conceived of as existing in reality and not just in the mind or else the gcb is not that being greater than which none can be conceived.\nSuppose (S) that the greatest conceivable being (GCB) exists in the mind alone and not in reality(gcb1).\n\nThen the greatest conceivable being would not be the greatest conceivable being because one could think of a being like (gcb1) but think of the gcb as existing in reality (gcb2) and not just in the mind.\n\nSo, gcb1 would not be the GCB but gcb2 would be.\nConclusion:\nThus to think of the GCB is to think of the gcb2, i.e. a being that exists in reality and not just in the mind.\n\n\n\nForm 2: God as Necessary Being\nPremises:\n\nGod is either a necessary being or a contingent being.\n\nThere is nothing contradictory about god being a necessary being\n\nSo, it is possible that god exists as a necessary being.\n\nSo if it is possible that God is a necessary being then God exists.\n\nBecause God is not a contingent being.\n\n\nConclusion:\nGod must exist as a necessary being.\n\n\nNotes on the Ontological arguments of Anselm and Descartes\nAnselm begins by defining the most central term in his argument - God. Without asserting that God exists, Anselm asks what is it that we mean when we refer to the idea of “God.” When we speak of a God, Anselm implies, we are speaking of the most supreme being. That is, let “god” = “something than which nothing greater can be thought.” Anselm’s definition of God might sound confusing upon first hearing it, but he is simply restating our intuitive understanding of what is meant by the concept “God.” Thus, for the purpose of this argument let “God” = “a being than which nothing greater can be conceived.”\nWithin your understanding, then, you possess the concept of God. As a non-believer, you might argue that you have a concept of unicorn (after all, it is the shared concept that allows us to discuss such a thing) but the concept is simply an idea of a thing. After all, we understand what a unicorn is but we do not believe that they exist. Anselm would agree.\n\n\nTwo key points have been made thus far:\n\nWhen we speak of God (whether we are asserting God is or God is not), we are contemplating an entity whom can be defined as “a being which nothing greater can be conceived.”;\nWhen we speak of God (either as believer or non-believer), we have an intra-mental understanding of that concept, i.e. the idea is within our understanding.\n\n\nAnselm continues by examining the difference between that which exists in the mind and that which exists both in the mind and outside of the mind as well. What is being asked here is: Is it greater to exist in the mind alone or in the mind and in reality (or outside of the mind)? Anselm asks you to consider the painter, e.g. define which is greater: the reality of a painting as it exists in the mind of an artist, or that same painting existing in the mind of that same artist and as a physical piece of art. Anselm contends that the painting, existing both within the mind of the artist and as a real piece of art, is greater than the mere intra-mental conception of the work. Let me offer a real-world example: If someone were to offer you a dollar, but you had to choose between the dollar that exists within their mind or the dollar that exists both in their mind and in reality, which dollar would you choose? Are you sure…\n\n\nAt this point, we have a third key point established:\n\nIt is greater to exist in the mind and in reality, then to exist in the mind alone.\n\nHave you figured out where Anselm is going with this argument?\n\nIf God is that than greater which cannot be conceived (established in #1 above);\nAnd since it is greater to exist in the mind and in reality than in the mind alone (established in #3 above);\nThen God must exist both in the mind (established in #2 above) and in reality;\nIn short, God must be. God is not merely an intra-mental concept but an extra-mental reality as well.\n\n\nBut why? Because if God is truly that than greater which cannot be conceived, it follows that God must exist both in the mind and in reality. If God did not exist in reality as well as our understanding, then we could conceive of a greater being i.e. a being that does exist extramentally and intramentally. But, by definition, there can be no greater being. Thus, there must be a corresponding extra-mental reality to our intra-mental conception of God. God’s existence outside of our understanding is logically necessary.\nSometimes, Anselm’s argument is presented as a Reductio Ad Absurdum (RAA). In an RAA, you reduce to absurdity the antithesis of your view. Since the antithesis is absurd, your view must be correct. Anselm’s argument would look something like this:\n\n\n\nEither [God exists] or [God does not exist].\nAssume [God does not exist] (the antithesis of Anselm’s position)\nIf [God does not exist] (but exists only as an intra-mental concept), then that being which nothing greater which can be conceived, is a being which a greater being can be conceived. This is a logical impossibility (remember criterion #3);\nTherefore, [God does not exist] is incorrect;\n\nConclusion:\n\nTherefore [God exists].\n\n\n\n\nClarifications:\n\nThe argument is not that “If you believe that god exists then god exists”.\nThat would be too ridiculous to ask anyone to accept that if you believe that X exists and is real then X exists and is real.\nThe ontological argument does not ask a person to assume that there is a deity or even a GCB.\n\n\nIt asks anyone at all to simply THINK of the deity as the GREATEST CONCEIVABLE BEING and then it indicates that a being that exists in reality (outside of the mind) is greater than one that is just in the mind (imagination). So, the conclusion is that if you think of the GCB you must THINK that the GCB exists not just in your thinking (mind) but in reality (outside of your mind) as well.\nIt is greater to think of a being existing outside of the mind as well as in the mind so if you think of the GCB you must THINK THAT the GCB exists not just inside of the mind (imagination) but outside of the mind as well (in reality).\nLook at it this way: Anselm invites people to think about a certain conception of the deity,i.e., that of the GCB. What Anselm did was to place into the concept itself the idea that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. So you THINK of the GCB and what are you doing when you do that? You must think that the GCB exists outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. Why must you think that? Because it you did not think that, then you would not be thinking of the GCB as defined by Anselm.\nIt is like this: Think of a triangle. If you do you must think of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees. Why? Because if you are not thinking of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees then you are not thinking of a triangle. So IF you are to THINK of a triangle you must THINK of a three sided figure lying on a plane with three angles adding up to 180 degrees.\nIf you are to THINK of a GCB you must THINK that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination. Why? Because if you are not thinking that the being must exist outside of the mind and in the realm of the real and not just inside the mind in the realm of imagination then you are not thinking of the GCB.\nIn all of this it is only thinking. Anselm proved what must be thought about the GCB given how the GCB was defined and not whether the GCB actually exists.\n\n\nA variation of this argument by Alvin Plantinga exists. It is known as the Modal Version of the Ontological Argument:\n\n\nTo say that there is possibly a God is to say that there is a possible world in which God exists.\nTo say that God necessarily exists is to say that God exists in every possible world.\nGod is necessarily perfect (i.e. maximally excellent)\nSince God is necessarily perfect, he is perfect in every possible world.\nIf God is perfect in every possible world, he must exist in every possible world, therefore God exists.\nGod is also maximally great. To be maximally great is to be perfect in every possible world.\nTherefore: “it is possible that there is a God,” means that there is a possible which contains God, that God is maximally great, and the God exists in every possible world and is consequently necessary.\nGod’s existence is at least possible.\nTherefore: as per item seven, God exists.\n\n\n\nRene Descartes, 1596 - 1650, is also credited with formulating a version of the ontological argument. One possible presentation of the Cartesian argument is as follows:\n\nIf there is a God it is a perfect being;\nA perfect being possesses all possible perfections;\nExistence is a perfection;\nTherefore, God necessarily possesses the quality of existence. Simply, God exists.\n\n\nThe actual texts:\nAnselm’s Philosophy\nAnselm’s Argument\nMonologium\nProslogium\nGuanilo’s Response and Anselm’s response to Guanilo\n\nPROBLEMS:\nThe problem with the ontological argument is NOT\n\nthat some people refuse to think of the GCB or\nthat some people have a resistance to a belief in a deity\nthat some people just refuse to accept the deity\n\nNO NO NO the problem with the Argument is that it has FLAWS. It has a LOGICAL MISTAKE in it.\nWhat is that error in the argument???",

The Most Perfect Island\nGaunilon, a contemporary of Anselm, had two major criticisms of the ontological argument.\n\nFirst: If by “God” we do mean “that than greater which can not be conceived,” then the concept is meaningless for us. We can not understand, in any meaningful way, what exactly is meant by such words. The reality behind the term is completely transcedent to the human knower;\nSecond: Even if we grant that the concept of God as “that than greater which can not be conceived” exists in the understanding, there is no reason to believe that the concept necessitates the extra-mental reality of God. After all, I can imagine the most perfect island, glorious in every detail, but there is nothing about my understanding of the island that forces us to admit the island exists.",

    "text": "II. Existence is not a predicate\nImmanuel Kant (1724 - 1804), offered what many believe to be a damning critique of Anselm’s ontological argument.\n\nLet us return to our discussion of unicorns and God.\nAnselm has argued that there exists a difference between the concept of “unicorn” as it exists intra-mentally and extra-mentally.\nIf we claim that the “unicorn” is, we are somehow adding to the concept. We are endowing the concept with an additional predicate, i.e. the quality that it is.\n\nThe point of Anselm’s argument is that the predicate of existence can be demonstrated for the concept of “God.”\n\nKant does not agree with Anselm’s treatment of existence as a predicate. The concept of “unicorn” is not changed in any way if we claim that it is. Nor is the concept damaged if we claim that unicorns are not. According to Kant,“…we do not make the least addition to the thing when we further declare that this thing is.” If existence is not a predicate, then Anselm’s argument has not demonstrated any meaningful information.\nKant thought that, while the concept of a supreme being was useful, it was only an idea, which in and of itself could not help us in our determining the correctness of the concept. While it was a possibility, he felt that the “a priori” stance of the argument it would be necessary to buttress it with experience.\nFor Kant what Anselm did was to prove that humans MUST THINK THAT a deity exists in reality and not just in the mind as an idea as the GCB but that does not mean that the GCB actually does exist in reality. The idea of the GCB exists and the idea of the GCB as an actual being does exist but the reality or actuality of the GCB is not established based on the thoughts alone.",

Since there could not exist two all-powerful beings (one’s power must be subordinate to the other), this is an example of one of the weaknesses in this type of theorizing. Furthermore, the concept of necessary existence, by using Anselm’s second argument, allows us to “define” other things into existence.\nThe argument could prove the existence of that being more EVIL than which no other can be conceived just as easily as it supposedly proves the existence of the being that is the greatest conceivable being.\nThink of a being that is the most evil being that can be conceived.

    "text": "IV. Empiricist Critique\nAquinas, 1225 - 1274, once declared the official philosopher of the Catholic Church, built his objection to the ontological argument on epistemological grounds.\n\nEpistemology is the study of knowledge. It is a branch of philosophy that seeks to answer such questions as: What is knowledge?; What is truth?; How does knowing occur?; et cetera. Aquinas is known as an empiricist. Empiricists claim that knowledge comes from sense experience. Aquinas wrote: “Nothing is in the intellect which was not first in the senses.”\nWithin Thomas’ empiricism, we can not reason or infer the existence of God from a studying of the definition of God. We can know God only indirectly, through our experiencing of God as Cause to that which we experience in the natural world. We can not assail the heavens with our reason; we can only know God as the Necessary Cause of all that we observe.\nAlvin Plantiga offers a counter argument to the counter arguments that at least establishes the rational acceptability of theism as it appears to support the idea that it is possible that the greatest conceivable being does exist.\n\n\n\nOther Philosophers and their Critiques:\n\nRené Descartes, from The Philosophy of Descartes in Extracts from His Writings.

Existence is not something we can know from the mere idea itself. It is not known as a predicate of a subject. Independent confirmation through experience is needed.\nThe argument does give some support to those who are already believers. It has variations that establish the possibility of the existence of such a being.\nThe argument will not convert the non-believer into a believer.\n\n\n\n\nOutcome Assessment\nThis argument or proof does not establish the actual existence of a supernatural deity. It attempts to define a being into existence and that is not rationally legitimate. While the argument can not be used to convert a non-believer to a believer, the faults in the argument do not prove that there is no god. The Burden of Proof demands that the positive claim that there is a supernatural deity be established by reason and evidence and this argument does not meet that standard. The believer in god can use the argument to establish the mere logical possibility that there is a supernatural deity or at least that it is not irrational to believe in the possibility that there is such a being. The argument does not establish any degree of probability at all.\n\nOUTCOME:\nThe Argument:\nPremises\n\nSuppose (S) that the greatest conceivable being (GCB) exists in the mind alone and not in reality(gcb1).\nThen the greatest conceivable being would not be the greatest conceivable being because one could think of a being like (gcb1) but think of the gcb as existing in reality (gcb2) and not just in the mind.\nSo, gcb1 would not be the GCB but gcb2 would be.\nThus to think of the GCB is to think of the gcb2, i.e. a being that exists in reality and not just in the mind.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: The GCB ( Deity) exists\nProblem with argument:\n\n____Premises are false\n____Premises are irrelevant\n____Premises Contain the Conclusion –Circular Reasoning\n__X__Premises are inadequate to support the conclusion\n____Alternative arguments exist with equal or greater support\n\n\n\nThis argument or proof has flaws in it and would not convince a rational person to accept its conclusion.\nThis is not because someone who does not believe in a deity will simply refuse to accept based on emotions or past history but because it is not rationally compelling of acceptance of its conclusion.\n\n\nIt would be a mistake in thinking, a violation of logic and a fallacy to think that because this argument or attempt to prove that there is a deity of some type does not work or has flaws that the opposite conclusion must be true, namely that there is no deity of any type. The error is known as the fallacy “argumentum ad ignoratio” or the appeal to ignorance. It is the mistake in thinking that if an argument cannot prove a proposition or claim P is true then P must be false. OR if you cannot prove that P is false then P must be true. It is a mistake to think that way., a logical error.\nProceed to the next section.\nCreative Commons License Introduction to Philosophy by Philip A.
