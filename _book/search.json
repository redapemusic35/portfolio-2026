    "text": "Session Format (When a Student is DM)\n\n1. Presentation of the Reading\nThe DM presents a summary of the assigned text. They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOtehr group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?",

While I still believe that the heavy emphasis on formal logic is important, it was not intuitive, and logic done well is intuitive. I eventually discovered Peter (smit21b?)’s Logic Matters. I recommended it to students as a supplementary reading and was pleased with the feedback and the improvement in their understanding. I am now relying on Smith’s introductory text as the main text for this course, although I will contrast it with Nolt’s more formal approach at various points.\nFocus: The focus of this course is . . .\nFree!

As a member of Stetson University, I agree to uphold the highest standards of integrity in my academic work. I promise that I will neither give nor receive unauthorized aid of any kind on my tests, papers, and assignments. When using the ideas, thoughts, or words of another in my work, I will always provide clear acknowledgement of the individuals and sources on which I am relying. I will avoid using fraudulent, falsified, or fabricated evidence and/or material. I will refrain from resubmitting without authorization work for one class that was obtained from work previously submitted for academic credit in another class. I will not destroy, steal, or make inaccessible any academic resource material. By my actions and my example, I will strive to promote the ideals of honesty, responsibility, trust, fairness, and respect that are at the heart of Stetson’s Honor System. Cheating violates university regulations and is a reportable offense that may result in academic suspension or dismissal from Stetson University. Every violation of the Honor System will be promptly reported to the Honor System Council for further investigation.

    "text": "University Supports and Policies\nPlease Note: Oral appeals for grade changes are NOT accepted. If you feel that you have an extremely strong case for a grade change, you may submit a one-page essay explaining your reasons to me within one week of your work being returned.\nA.Honor Code: University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. Any attempt at academic cheating will be referred to the Honor Council. I expect you to abide by the Honor Code that we have adopted here at Stetson. Please sign all work “Pledged, your name.” University rules concerning scholastic dishonesty will be strictly followed. As a community of intellectual inquirers, we are all committed to academic integrity and honesty. The Stetson University Student Government Association, on its own initiative, recently drafted a proposal for an honor code, a powerful statement of the student body’s commitment to this community of honor and integrity. For this reason, all work that you turn in must be your own. Any contribution from others must be clearly acknowledged. Unauthorized assistance on exams (take-home as well as in-class), research papers, or projects can be neither given nor received. The University has fully endorsed its honor system and abides by its precepts. If you have questions regarding the method/procedure for citing the work of others, please feel free to consult us.\nThe Department of Philosophy expects academic honesty of all students; we expect all students to abide by Stetson’s honor code and to adhere to the honor system. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, altering or misusing documents, plagiarizing, misrepresentation, knowingly providing false information, colluding, and other forms of cheating. Students should read and follow Stetson’s definitions and policies on ‘Academic Honesty,’ the honor code, and the honor system in Connections: The Campus Life Handbook and Calendar. It is the student’s responsibility to be familiar with these definitions and policies; ignorance of them is not an acceptable excuse for violating them. Cases of suspected academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, will be referred to the Academic Honor Council, as per departmental policy.\nThe honor code can be found online at the following address:http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/ http://www.stetson.edu/honorsystem/\nB.Assignment standards: Late Work: All assignments must be handed in on time: late work will be docked a half-letter grade per day unless you get my approval for an extension before the due date. (Student athletes and others on school business: please, be advised to turn your assignments in BEFORE you leave, not after you return). No make-up exams or quizzes will be given without documented University accepted excuse (and they will differ from the ones given in class). This includes group quizzes.\nC.Accommodation: Writing Center: Many students experience difficulty writing research papers. For that reason, Stetson University supports a Writing Center, located on the Second Floor of the Library. I have found that one or two visits to the Writing Center can make a tremendous difference in the quality of a paper. If you find that you have trouble with your written assignments, I strongly encourage you to seek the help of the Writing Center. The Academic Success Center provides academic and disability resources for all Stetson University Students. Students who anticipate barriers related to the format or requirements of a course should meet with me to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (386-822-7127; www.stetson.edu/asc). You and I, and the ASC, will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. Sheridan’s writing center hours: W 2-6, F 12-3.\nThe ASC also coordinates free tutoring on campus for students. You can meet with a tutor to review principles, learn content-specific study strategies, and enhance content area knowledge. To review the tutoring options available and schedules, please see our website www.stetson.edu/asc/tutoring/php.\n2.Counseling: Counseling: College can be extremely stressful for students, especially if this is the first time you’ve been away from home for an extended period of time or if there are other pressures that you are facing. For this reason, you may find it helpful to consult the University Counseling Center. Here is their contact information:\nPhone number: 386-822-8900\nLocation: The office is located in Griffith Hall\nOffice hours: Weekdays from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\nIf a student experiences a mental health emergency after hours, they can simply call Public Safety (386-822-7300) and ask to speak with the on-call counselor.\nWe are staffed with qualified professional counselors who are trained to support and guide students through difficult transitions, experiences, and feelings.\nCounseling is confidential and free of charge for all currently enrolled Stetson University students.\nIf experiencing a mental health crisis, you may also call 386-822-8740 to be connected to Volusia County Crisis Response Team: If having thoughts of harming yourself or others, select option one. For all other mental health needs select option nine.\nFor medical emergencies call 911.\nSchedule of Readings/Assignments: subject to change as needed, it is YOUR responsibility to regularly check blackboard for announcements.\nStudents are required to check their Stetson email and Canvas accounts frequently, daily if possible. Do not use technology as an excuse for not completing an assignment/quiz or for submitting an assignment/quiz late or improperly. Late assignments/submissions are not accepted.\nAll students will be asked to verify in an online quiz that they agree and will abide by the procedures and policies presented in this syllabus. If you do not feel you can abide by the course rules, please drop the course.\nAny recordings of this class (audio, video, or otherwise) may ONLY be used for personal academic use. Recordings may NOT be shared with other people without written consent from the professor. The information contained in recordings constitutes intellectual property and is protected under federal copyright laws. This information may NOT be published or quoted without the express written consent of the professor and without giving proper identification and credit to the professor. Recordings of this class may not be used in any way against the faculty member, teaching assistant, other lecturer, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class. Violation of these stipulations will result in being reported to the Office of Community Standards.\nD. Food Insecurity: At Stetson University, we are committed to supporting students’ well-being, including ensuring access to nutritious food. If you are experiencing a lack of access to safe and nutritious food, the Hatters Helping Hatters Food Pantry is her to help. The Food Pantry is a free, no-questions-asked supplemental food resource for all Stetson students, staff & faculty. Food Pantry location:\n\nCarlton Union Building (CUB 278), open 24 hours.",

What is consciousness, What is reality?, What is knowledge?.\n\n\n\nHere’s the deal:\nYou roll dice. You defend a position. Is it yours? Who cares. You make choices, are they yours? No, they belong to your avatar. You question your beliefs? No, you question your avatar’s beliefs. You eat your friend.\nThis is not a game. It’s a philosophy lab inside an experience machine.\nBy December, you’ll have lived Socrates, Descartes, Mill, and Rawls — not just read them.\nPick one, this is your character for the rest of the course. That character’s beliefs are your beliefs. In fact, its better that we don’t share our personal beliefs. Make up some. Write your name on them.\nToday, we begin in Room A.

And this is by no means so difficult a task as the history of philoso- phy would lead one to suppose.

They will then present a D&D structured adventure of the text (this will be provided).\n\nThe core issues of the text will be narratively framed already: The group will be a party of adventurers whose job it is to solve the issues before them in order to advance.\nThe reading is the “quest” or “dungeon” backdrop—e.g., a moral/ethical, metaphysical/epistemological dilemma in a kingdom, or a riddle posed by an adversarial entity (the DM).\n\n\n\n2. Challenges Presented One at a Time\nThe DM introduces several challenges sequentially\n\nEach challenge draws directly from key concepts, arguments, objections, or thought experiments in the reading.\nExamples:\n\nYou’ve created an intelligent and conscious sim population \\(\\rightarrow\\) Debate your obligations to them.\nYou’ve fallen in love with a player in an MMO who you only know as their character \\(\\rightarrow\\) Explore is this true love?\n\n\n\n\n3. Group Interaction & Participation\nFor each challenge:\n\nany group member can respond by:\n\nAsking a clarifying question about the challenge (probing the text/concept).\nOffering a suggestion/solution (proposing a philosophical position, argument, or counter).\n\nThe DM evaluates the response (as the “world” reacting).\n\nThe responding player ***rolls dice (typically a d20, we will ignore modifiers this time around) to determine whether they defend the position or attack it.\nSuccess means attacking the position\nFailure means defending the position\n\n\n\n\n4. Collaborative Input & Multiple Rolls\nAfter the first response/roll:\n\nOtehr group member get turns to offer their own responses or build on/counter the previous one.\nThey also roll dice to suggest “other considerations” (e.g., other defenses of the DM’s positions; other criticism’s of the DM’s position; edge cases; objections from the reading)\nThis creates a back-and-forth discussion, with dice adding chance, excitement, and stakes—mirroring how philosophical debates involve risk, uncertainty, and persuasion.\n\n\n\n5. Resolution & Reflection\n\nThe DM adjudicates the collective outcomes (what is plausible?)\nThe session ends with debrief: How did the “adventure” illuminate the reading? What arguments won/lost? How does this apply to real philosophy?",
